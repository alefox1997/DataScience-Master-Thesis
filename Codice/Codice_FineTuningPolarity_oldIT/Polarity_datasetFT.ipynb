this  book at a bargain price -- pick it up!</text>, <text>The fourth psychological thriller from Michael Marshall Smith (writing under his truncated pseudonym) is a departure from his Straw Men universe</text>, <text>Its a Seattle based thriller which deceptively begins as a genre piece, goes on to transcend genre conventions and eventually develops into a dark rumination on identity, relationships, paths not taken and the nature of ourselves</text>, <text>Marshall Smith's usual themes, concerns and metaphors are present but have been refined to the point of grand eloquence and this time around have been coupled with a use of imagery which puts this on a par with so-called literary fiction: architecture becomes symbolic of the human psyche and old unrepaired radios haunt living spaces like the regrets that we all carry with us</text>, <text>I can't really describe the plot without blowing it, suffice to say, you need to experience it for yourself and I highly recommend that you do</text>, <text>Whether writing as Marshall or Marshall Smith, this is a novelist who has always been way ahead in his field and he only gets better with every book</text>, <text>If you haven't experienced him in either incarnation, you've missed a treat and this novel is a perfect place to begin familiarising yourself with his work</text>, <text>\"As complete a dossier on the life and times of Capone as is conceivable</text>, <text>fascinating</text>, <text>\" New York Times Book Review</text>, <text>Here is the ultimate biography of the most brutal, flamboyant gangster of all time-Al Capone</text>, <text>From his violent childhood to his notorious St</text>, <text>Valentine's Day massacre to his eventual control of Chicago, here is the inside scoop on \"Snorky\" aka \"Scarface\" aka \"Public Enemy Number One</text>, <text>\" Capone is a classic in true crime literature</text>, <text>Like this book because it is just like my life in a lot of was</text>, <text>For one I'm a teenage and have a baby</text>, <text>This book teach me in a lot of way</text>, <text>Out of all the books I read this is the best</text>, <text>My darling,My hamburger is a good book if it didn't live you hang at the end what hope to whom and did they  go to collage or not</text>, <text>And lots of fun for the adult who refuses to grow up</text>, <text>Garth Nix has created a surprising world of fascinating characters and ideas</text>, <text>The plot moves right along and the young hero is likeable and delightfully normal</text>, <text>The book only occasionally does more telling than showing (mostly related to character emotions) but you'll hardly notice</text>, <text>It's one of the most inventive, Wonderland-adventures I've read in a long time</text>, <text>Counting the days until Grim Tuesday is released</text>, <text>The book had a far-fetched premise, but once I was able to move past that detail, the book was readable, albeit unrealistic</text>, <text>Without giving away anything significant, I can tell you that a major portion of the book was centered around a police officer assuming an alias</text>, <text>Unfortunately, I was a little surprised, and very disappointed in the way the author chose to \"reveal\" the main undercover operation to the criminal</text>, <text>The unraveling of the cover was brought about by a mistake that I found completely innane</text>, <text>I could not believe that a rookie, much less a seasoned officer would slip up as the author has Carol (and Tony) slip up</text>, <text>This disbelief is compounded by the lengths that are taken initially to insure that the operation is not comprimised</text>, <text>I was disappointed enough in the book to move along to another author, as opposed to reading the rest of the Carol Jordan/Tony Hill saga</text>, <text>I thought the writing skills of the author were good, but the storytelling skills were not</text>, <text>I read this book in high school and loved it</text>, <text>It was written in a way that felt just like my life at the time</text>, <text>I just bought it again recently and I still love it</text>, <text>One of my favorite books of all time</text>, <text>Paul Zindel is an amazing author!</text>, <text>Dark fantasy writer Garth Nix expanded his readership with his excellent \"Seventh Tower\" series, an original and much-publicized fantasy work</text>, <text>Now he expands further, in a darker, grittier, more realistic fantasy set in our world, where a confused young boy has to escape dark forces that want to use him for their own ends -- or kill him</text>, <text>Arthur Penhaligon has asthma</text>, <text>As a result, he ends up in the hospital regularly</text>, <text>But one day he encounters a strange man called Mr</text>, <text>Monday and his creepy butler, who leave him with a Key shaped like a minute hand and a little book with dancing letters</text>, <text>When he returns home after another stay in the hospital, Arthur finds that the Key seems to be attracting unwanted attention -- a statue of a Komodo dragon comes alive, and a winged man-dog tries to come into his house</text>, <text>What's more, a House has appeared -- one that is also inside the little book</text>, <text>Soon Arthur is being pursued by more dog-faced Fetchers, and a strange plague is sweeping his town -- and somehow the Key is keeping him alive, even though he was supposed to die of an asthma attack</text>, <text>His answers lie inside the House</text>, <text>But what lies beyond it is like nothing in our world, where ghastly nithlings roam and the Piper's children run wild in the streets</text>, <text>And the sinister Mr</text>, <text>Monday wants the Key back</text>, <text>Garth Nix takes his focus from high fantasy -- such as the Abhorsen trilogy or the Seventh Tower series -- to a more modern fantasy that takes place in our world</text>, <text>Though Arthur skips to another world, he's clearly from our own</text>, <text>But Nix doesn't downplay his brand of horrific fantasy either; stuff that would seem silly for most other authors, like dog-faced monsters, is magic in his hands</text>, <text>The writing is detailed, evocative, and never lags for a minute</text>, <text>As in his other books, he melds an exceptional, original fantasy world with elements of horror</text>, <text>The handling of the parallel world, the Will, Sneezer, and the Key and Atlas are all wonderfully woven together, not to mention the characters of Dawn, Dusk, Noon for each day, and so on</text>, <text>At the same time, we have the bloodwinged, silver-tongued Noon and the ugly Fetchers, not to mention the hideous nithlings</text>, <text>This is dark fantasy at its best</text>, <text>Arthur is a likable kid, with an unusual problem for fantasy heroes (namely, asthma)</text>, <text>Like most of Nix's heroes, the poor kid is desperately running and searching, and learning from those ahead of him</text>, <text>Quirky Suzy is reminiscent of a Lloyd Alexander heroine, strong and brave and just a little strange</text>, <text>\"Mister Monday\" is another great book from Garth Nix, combining darkness and fantasy and leaving the ending open for the second book of the series</text>, <text>An intriguing, enthralling book</text>, <text>In an effort to do whatever he can to save his family, his friends, and his world, Arthur Penhaligon enters the strange House that only he can see</text>, <text>What he finds inside will change him forever</text>, <text>This is a suspenseful story packed with adventure</text>, <text>Mister Monday tells the story of young Arthur Penhaligon's attempt to save the world, or at least his community and family, from a deadly virus</text>, <text>It certainly sounds simple enough, but this novel is anything but simple</text>, <text>Once again Nix takes the reader to unimaginable places where danger is always at hand and the rules aren't what they seem</text>, <text>THis series isn't as good as the Abhorson series, but then it is aimed at a younger audience</text>, <text>Even so, this series is well worth reading</text>, <text>The characters are likeable, the plot is complicated yet compelling and the writing superb</text>, <text>This fantasy will certainly hit the mark for anyone who enjoys the genre</text>, <text>I wish I could give a summary! This book, hyped to be the first in the \"next Harry Potter\" was so confusing that I can't figure out what was happening or why it was supposed to be important</text>, <text>Ok, that's a slight exaggeration</text>, <text>I managed to figure out what was happening, more or less</text>, <text>But this is definitely not the next Harry Potter</text>, <text>The main character, a young asthmatic with greatness thrust upon him is not fleshed out very well, nor do we see much growth in him from the beginning of the book until the end</text>, <text>His supposed motivation for jumping through all the hoops that Nix puts him through is to find a cure for the plague that's sweeping his hometown, but it really seems like he's just going through the motions because he has to</text>, <text>Perhaps his motivations become clearer in the next 6 books, or perhaps we see some growth in the character, but I'm not sure I care enough to go through 6 more books</text>, <text>This book is so cool! My friend gave it to me for Christmas when I was 8, and I have read it a lot of times</text>, <text>Okay, it's about these two twins, Angela and Diabola</text>, <text>Angela is named because she acts like an angel, and Diabola is named because she acts diabolic (evil)</text>, <text>Lynnee Reid Banks (the author) is  an excellent writer and the story is understandable, because I understanded  when I was 8</text>, <text>Just read this book today! I'm sure you'll read other reviews  and they'll tell ya more</text>, <text>It was a great book and its based in a place near where  I live</text>, <text>I think it was good because when he figures out who the murderer is, he's eye to eye with him</text>, <text>I have always had a particular interest in children/teen fantasy</text>, <text>I normally am an adult fantasy reader, but sometimes it is nice to read a book that isn't trying to play off like the real world</text>, <text>This book is such a clever, compelling read that I was sorely disappointed to have to wait for more</text>, <text>I have never (so far) read a Garth Nix book that doesn't re-inspire me to read more books</text>, <text>Anyway, onto the actually book itself</text>, <text>We are introduced to the typical male-boy protagonist, the awkward in school, unsure of himself protagonist with an incredible future</text>, <text>Arthur soon learns that his immediate problems are not the first day of school, but instead are the fact that he has to become the heir to the center of the universe</text>, <text>The entire idea of the House with different levels of work (mostly paperwork) is extremely creative</text>, <text>Everything about the environment and, we could say, culture of the House is a parody and play on real life</text>, <text>It is ironic that the nether-world still has to deal with paperwork and useless workers and bosses that could care less if what they are doing is right or not</text>, <text>The House also offers a sense of the extreme</text>, <text>Anything described inside usually is accompanied by ridiculous dimensions</text>, <text>For example any major room is about 40-50 football fields length or the job of filling a few hundred thousand ink bottles</text>, <text>It also offers a different version of the afterlife, as in it doesn't exist</text>, <text>The main reoccurring theme is \"from nothing we came, and to nothing we return\" a bit unsettling for the typical child</text>, <text>And that brings me to my next point</text>, <text>These books are labeled, \"Children Fantasy\", but contains many references to myths and ideas that I believe are beyond a normal 9 year's old pool of knowledge</text>, <text>There are also a few really violent scenes that make me want to classify this more for Teens</text>, <text>Not that I am saying don't read this for the violence, just be warned if your a parent I recommend reading this ahead of time to make sure it'd be ok for your child (and really it only takes about a day or two to do)</text>, <text>In conclusion, this is a highly originally tale and I for one can't wait to read the other books of this series</text>, <text>My only complaint is that Garth Nix takes about a year for every book he writes and that's a long time to wait</text>, <text>But I guess if it makes the books a masterpiece, it's a small sacrifice</text>, <text>If there is any tool of education which highlights our depraved society, it is this book</text>, <text>I am sure Paul Zindel means well, but his outlook on human life is simplistic at best and cynical at worst</text>, <text>The man clearly believes humanity is a small step above animals, and that our children should be raised to accept their fate in this Ricki Lake world in which we live</text>, <text>This is the sort of book that turns children into sex and relationship obsessed creatures, consumed with nothing but the desire to eat and procreate</text>, <text>It is for those who desire nothing more than to live like cattle, with some improved diversion courtesy other human inventors (ie television)</text>, <text>What is even worse is reading the reviews of this book</text>, <text>Wow</text>, <text>This book far surpassed my expectations</text>, <text>It was intense and creepy</text>, <text>I really had no idea how the book would end, which kept me turning the pages to find out</text>, <text>I was hooked from the first chapter, and it was a wild ride until the end</text>, <text>Overall, The Intruders is an excellent book</text>, <text>It is well worth your time to read this one</text>, <text>I am a big fan of Garth Nix and really enjoyed his \"Abhorsen\" series</text>, <text>Then I heard that this series came out and that it was getting really good reviews, so I checked it out of the library</text>, <text>It was as good as promised</text>, <text>The whole plot is very interesting and loaded with symbolism</text>, <text>It is about Arthur, an average boy who turns into an extraordinary boy</text>, <text>The character development is very good for the supporting characters like Suzy Blue and the Will, but not so good for Arthur himself</text>, <text>ANyway, the book was action packed and very fast paced</text>, <text>It is the first of a seven-part series (one for each day of the week)</text>, <text>The other three that are out by now are equally good, but the whole series is VERY fast-paced</text>, <text>I really enjoy this series, and I can't wait for the Friday to come</text>, <text>Meanwhile, I will reread the last four to pick up all the little symbols and clues that Nix casually scatters through the story</text>, <text>In this book, Ernest Gellner uses the psychoanalytic movement as a \"case study\" to explore the general human tendency to create delusional ideological systems which serve various political, social, and psychological needs</text>, <text>He also focuses in on the specific structural features of modern life that made psychoanalysis an especially successful ideology</text>, <text>As Gellner sums up in his final chapter, \"In a sense, the present book is more interested in our Zeitgeist than in psychoanalysis</text>, <text>The crucial strategic position occupied by Freudianism in the social and intellectual history of mankind, makes it possible for us to learn a vast amount from it about, on the one hand, the general anatomy of belief systems and, on the other, the special conditions prevalent in our age</text>, <text>\"</text>, <text>In his first two chapters, Gellner focuses in on what might be called the modern predicament</text>, <text>Before the rise of natural science and philosophical empiricism, it was easy to explain the mixture of good and evil, the sheer perversity, embodied in human beings</text>, <text>Humans were, quite literally, halfway between beasts and angels</text>, <text>The rise of science and modern philosophy invalidated that belief</text>, <text>Taking David Hume as a prime example, Gellner shows that the scientific, empiricist thought of the Enlightenment abandoned the angel/beast dichotomy</text>, <text>The Enlightenment theorists naturalized man: the model of man they ended up with, which Gellner dubs the \"Bundleman,\" was a random mixture of self-interested desires and needs which were easily satisfied by a conservatively cautious policy of maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain</text>, <text>Real human beings, of course, act much more like a mixture of angel and beast than the cautiously and rationally selfish \"Bundleman\" of the Enlightenment</text>, <text>Nietzsche was, Gellner claims, the first serious post-Enlightenment thinker to fully realize this fact, and the realization finally drove poor Nietzsche insane</text>, <text>Freud's genius was to take the Nietzschean insight and domesticate it, thereby turning it into the basis of a very successful, very lucrative pseudo-scientific cult - psychoanalysis</text>, <text>Freud's task was made easier by certain features of the modern world</text>, <text>The modern world exhibits deep reverence for applied science, especially medicine</text>, <text>In modern industrial societies, technology has eradicated most traditional physical threats (starvation, plague, wild animals, etc</text>, <text>)</text>, <text>In our society, the pressing threats perceived by most people lie rather in the increasing complexity of, and importance placed upon, human relationships</text>, <text>It is just in this area of interpersonal relationships where psychoanalysis offered help</text>, <text>Most of the book explores the tricks and turns by which psychoanalysis maintained its authority</text>, <text>Nowadays, now that there is hardly an intelligent person left who is a hard-core believer in the Freudian faith, is this of any more than historical interest?</text>, <text>Yes</text>, <text>While Freud may finally be buried, his residue endures -- as \"therapy,\" \"couselling,\" \"adjustment,\" etc</text>, <text>-- and continues to muddle our thinking process and our ability to make moral evaluations</text>, <text>As Gellner rhetorically asks, concerning the Holy Grail of \"adjustment,\" \"[I]s adaptation, adjustment to any regime, including a tyrannical one, a sign of mental health?\"  The Soviets, hardly orthodox Freudians, famously answered \"Yes!\"</text>, <text>But even more important, as Gellner emphasizes, the fraud of Freudianism is a typical example of the functioning of human society in general:</text>, <text>\"Societies possess techniques for rendering ideas socially constitutive, and these techniques tend to share certain formal features</text>, <text>It is important to remember that this is the normal condition of mankind: most ideas of most men at most times are beyond the reach of questioning</text>, <text>An idea does not have simply a cognitive role</text>, <text>it is at the same time linked to a set of personal relations, to loyalties, hierarchies, sentiments, hopes and fears</text>, <text>To shake the idea would be to disturb all that</text>, <text>Most men are neither willing nor able to do that</text>, <text>\"</text>, <text>To put it more bluntly, the structure of all hitherto existing human societies is grounded in socially-imposed, emotionally-compelling lies</text>, <text>Did Freud and his colleagues engage in bizarre intellectual contortions to prevent their ideas from being questioned or subjected to criticism?</text>, <text>Yes</text>, <text>but have you ever asked a liberal why we must slavishly accede to the results of a democratic election?  The answer is that if you choose to vote, you are obliged to accept the results, and, if you don't vote, you have no right to complain</text>, <text>Is Freudian reasoning any more circular than that?</text>, <text>Did Freud and his colleagues frantically avoid confronting their theories with empirical reality?  (Freud once declared that \"I cannot advise too strongly against\" seeking out empirical evidence to check the conclusions of a psychoanalytic diagnosis because the result would be that \"confidence in the analysis is shattered and a court of appeal is set up over it</text>, <text>\")</text>, <text>Yes</text>, <text>but have you ever talked with a conservative about the actual historical process by which the US Constitution was \"ratified\"?</text>, <text>Do Freudians apply different standards to themselves than to all other human beings, accusing critics and skeptics of being mentally and morally deranged?</text>, <text>Yes</text>, <text>but have you ever tried asking a Christian why, since they preach that Jesus taught the pacifist doctrines of \"Resist not evil!\" and \"Turn the other cheek!\", many Christians are among the most violent and militaristic people on the planet?</text>, <text>What then would happen if everyone learned the central lesson of Gellner's book -- that deception, dishonesty, and manipulation are at the heart not only of the psychoanalytic movement but of nearly all forms of social authority?</text>, <text>If people simply cease believing in authority, them, like Tinkerbell, authority simply dies</text>, <text>If the world were free of lies, deception, and manipulation, then the authority of clergymen and governments, of judges, schoolteachers, psychotherapists, professors, and policemen, would all simply disappear</text>, <text>Garbagemen can still collect garbage, farmers can still farm, and deliverymen can still deliver even if no one \"believes' in them</text>, <text>But if no one believes in clergymen, or psychoanalysts, or Presidents, then there would no longer be clergymen, psychoanalysts, or Presidents</text>, <text>Like Tinkerbell, they would simply fade away</text>, <text>And, perhaps, that would be a very good thing indeed</text>, <text>Mister Monday is one of the best books I have read in a long time</text>, <text>You immediately connect with Arthur-- he has his weaknesses (asthma and being too curious for his own good) and he has his strengths (his sense of duty, compassion, and courage)</text>, <text>This book is jam-packed with many fantastical inventions that is purely Nix at his best</text>, <text>Dog-faced men, the Will, the Nightsweeper, and thousands more</text>, <text>I repeat: this is an extremely compelling read and you'll be hard-fixed to find anything as wonderfully written as this</text>, <text>Thank you and good night!</text>, <text>\"Class Trip\" was definitly one of my favorite books ever, and most likely will always be one</text>, <text>I would really love to read another one of Bebe Faas Rice's books very very much</text>, <text>The twist at the ending was thought out well</text>, <text>i never wouldv'e guessed it</text>, <text>I passed it around all of my friends and they loved it too</text>, <text>I'm having trouble finding any of her other books</text>, <text>I got \"class trip\" from a library for 10 cents</text>, <text>It was obviously worth alot more! :)</text>, <text>I will be perfectly honest, Mister Monday is amazing</text>, <text>I have read many fantasy books in my life, but this one really wowed me</text>, <text>Garth Nix creates a vast array of imaginative creatures with incredible talents</text>, <text>Take the Fetchers for instance</text>, <text>They are man like creatures with a dog's face and teeth</text>, <text>I would not want to run into a fetcher in a dark alley</text>, <text>Nix also uses a fantasy theme that we have all seen in the movies: interdimensional travel</text>, <text>Though I enjoyed fantasy theme, I do think that Nix went slightly overboard</text>, <text>Even fantasy books have to be a little bit realistic</text>, <text>All and all, the book was great, and I recommend it to fantasy readers everywhere</text>, <text>This is the first book in the Keys to the Kingdom series by Garth Nix</text>, <text>It was supposed to have a book every six months for 2 1/2 years, but it seems Mr, Nix unfortunately could not deliver on that so it is like most other series, in 1 every year or so(give or take a month)</text>, <text>Which is kind of annoying if you wanted them every 6 instead of 12 months, but the quality of writing would be hurt I believe if that had occured so I am quite happy waiting for the book \"Sir Thursday\" right now</text>, <text>Mister Monday takes place on a Monday(make sense) when Arthur our \"Hero\" happens to become the heir to a will that was divided a century or so ago by the \"Morrow Days,\" which are the days of the week,a nd they operate in the \"Secondary Realms\" only on the day in which they are named</text>, <text>This was not supposed to happen, the Days were supposed to keep the Will whole and pass it on to a rightful heir without conflict</text>, <text>Which of course can NOT happen or we would not have this great series</text>, <text>So Arthur has asthma VERY severely in fact and almost dies, but survive because Mr</text>, <text>Monday gives Arthur the minute hand to the \"Key to the Kingdom\" that he posesses</text>, <text>The key makes it possible for Arthur to live through a brutal asthma attack on the first day at this new school</text>, <text>Now Arthur starts to see things that he had never seen before, and must make it into Monday's postern to get to the house, grab the Hour hand to complete the key and take over 1/7 th of the houses power</text>, <text>So along the way he meets Suzy Turquoise Blue who once was a human like Arthur, but has become a \"denizen\" of the house where it is almost impossible to be killed/die and you never Have to eat or drink, and never get colds</text>, <text>They are used a fashion accesories and show the other denizens you have a status as they are hard to acquire and expensive</text>, <text>So Arthur and Suzy have many encounters and then are captured, and Arthur is thrown into the Coal Cellar of the realms and meets the  \"Ancient One\" who tells him the stories and some of the secrets of the realms inside the house and about the \"improbable stair\" which only excists if you are able to see it and able to transfer from one realm to another quickly without losing it and being stranded in the realm forever</text>, <text>Eventually it leads to a battle which is quite large in scale and Arthur does triumph even with his asthma and various other faults, which makes him a likable character, he is not perfect, He is a child and has health problems, so he is more real than these characters who have no faults at all</text>, <text>This series is great, and I recommend it to anyone to read it, enjoy it and read the other 2(so far) in the series, as well as his Seventh Tower, and the Sabriel, Lirael, Abhorsen series, theya re all great</text>, <text>With apologies to anyone who is reading this as a duplicative review, I am going to review all four of Val McDermid's Dr</text>, <text>Tony Hill/Carol Jordan novels in one place and copy the reviews individually</text>, <text>I've now read seven of McDermid's books</text>, <text>She's not a great writer but she's a fabulous storyteller and her Tony Hill/Carol Jordan mysteries are the best of the bunch</text>, <text>The first two books aren't written terribly well, but the writing gets better as the series goes on</text>, <text>You may know these characters from the BBC series \"Wire in the Blood\" starring Robson Green</text>, <text>As an aside, while I generally find film and television adaptations to be far less satisfying than the source material on which they are based, the BBC series is really an exception</text>, <text>While the books have some detail that doesn't make it to the t</text>, <text>v</text>, <text>series, the television program really brings the characters to life and improves on the writing while staying true to the novels, although only the fourth book's plot actually made it to the screen</text>, <text>As noted by some other reviewers, these books are not for the squeamish</text>, <text>McDermid doesn't pull any punches in writing about vicious psychopaths who commit sex crimes and the books may well be disturbing to many</text>, <text>The second book in particular (more below) actually gave me nightmares</text>, <text>McDermid, however, really gets into the heads of her twisted antagonists and she seems to have done a tremendous amount of research</text>, <text>Most importantly, both Dr</text>, <text>Hill, a clinical psychologist who consults with the police as a profiler, and Carol Jordan, the police officer with whom he works most closely, always feel like real people with investigative abilities and compassion that are easy to admire and foibles that are easy to relate to</text>, <text>They have serious difficulties in forging personal relationships which makes their relationship all the more poignant</text>, <text>Each book focuses on two stories -- a main investigation involving a psychopath and a secondary case that is generally no less compelling, while also following the relationship that develops between the two protagonists</text>, <text>If you've never read any of the books in this series, I would recommend taking them in order</text>, <text>The fourth book is the best, the third the worst, but it's worth reading them in order for the character development (although you could easily skip the third)</text>, <text>If you really think you only want to read one, or aren't sure and don't care about spolers, just go straight to the last one</text>, <text>Some people who have read the entire series have found the fourth book repetitive, but it's the one that really works on all levels</text>, <text>Overall, the series gets 4 stars, but here are my individual assessments:</text>, <text>SPOILER FREE REVIEWS</text>, <text>1</text>, <text>The Mermaids Singing - 4 stars</text>, <text>The first of the series is really the only one that delves in any great detail into the personal lives of Tony Hill and Carol Jordan, who come together to investigate the brutal torture and slayings of four men in northern England</text>, <text>McDermid's Tony Hill/Carol Jordan books all deal with issues of sexual identity, but this one does is particularly focused on that as the police suspect a gay man of killing heterosexual men</text>, <text>McDermid shares the thoughts of the killer as well as those of Dr</text>, <text>Hill, who relates all too well to the motivations of the subjects he is asked to profile</text>, <text>The writing in this book is kind of clunky, but the insights of the author into how and why someone sets out to cause maximum pain and humiliation still make it a riveting, if disturbing, read</text>, <text>2</text>, <text>The Wire in the Blood -- 4 stars</text>, <text>In this second book in the series, teenaged girls are being abducted and brutally raped and tortured to death</text>, <text>We are introduced to an extremely smooth and charismatic character, Jacko Vance, a television celebrity and former star athlete, that Dr</text>, <text>Hill and Carol Jordan called upon to investigate</text>, <text>This is the hardest of the series to read, probably because the killer's victims are all extremely young, naive and female, with no chance whatsoever of fighting back</text>, <text>This book deals with charisma and celebrity as well as sexual deviance and although the writing is still somewhat awkward, it's generally a more compelling novel than the Mermaids Singing</text>, <text>3</text>, <text>The Last Temptation -- 3 stars</text>, <text>This is the weakest book in the series</text>, <text>On the plus side, McDermid decides to branch out from northern England and take the reader into continental Europe, particularly Germany, where Carol Jordan has gone as an undercover operative to investigate a drug dealer/slave trader</text>, <text>Tony Hill is also in Europe, helping the police solve a series of murders in which psychologists are the victims</text>, <text>McDermid brings to light some of the darker deeds of the Nazis that are generally not known and discussed and for this she should be commended</text>, <text>The writing also starts to improve with this book and the secondary protagonists, two female, European police officers who develop a long-term relationship with each other, are the best of any of the books</text>, <text>There are some serious problems with the novel, however, that make it the weakest of the bunch</text>, <text>First of all, in the other books McDermid is writing about the North of England, which she clearly knows like the back of her hand</text>, <text>The locale in the other books is really the third character after Tony Hill and Carol Jordan</text>, <text>The European locations never quite come to life in the same way</text>, <text>But the biggest problem with The Last Temptation is that McDermid tries too hard to force a particular ending</text>, <text>In order to get where she wants to go, she has to have Carol Jordan do something completely out of character and, frankly, she doesn't do a good job of convincing us of the reason</text>, <text>The whole book feels a bit contrived</text>, <text>Kudos to McDermid for trying something different instead of just writing variations on a theme, but the theme is one she does really well and this effort is a bit disappointing</text>, <text>4</text>, <text>The Torment of Others -- 5 stars</text>, <text>There's a reason this is the only story that got used in the BBC series</text>, <text>By this point, McDermid had started to write really well, and she'd really gotten the hang of tying the two story lines together</text>, <text>In the main story, someone is killing prostitutes with the m</text>, <text>o</text>, <text>used by a man currently in an insane asylum</text>, <text>How does the killer know exactly what the prior murderer did? The mystery is more satisfying than that of the prior novels and the sub-plot, involving kidnapped boys, also intrigues</text>, <text>There's not much to learn at this point about Dr</text>, <text>Hill, but while the third book didn't entirely work, the aftereffects of that novel's events on Carol Jordan are all too real and bring the characters' relationship to a new level</text>, <text>If books on criminal profiling and psychological forensics are your thing, you'll probably really enjoy McDermid's work</text>, <text>If someone has recommended her writing to you and the Dr</text>, <text>Hill/Carol Jordan mysteries sound like they are too gruesome, check out the Grave Tattoo, which is a neat, little literary mystery</text>, <text>Angela and Diabola is not only a good book for girls, but also for boys with a good sense of imagination</text>, <text>The book ranges between nine-year-olds through eleven-year-olds</text>, <text>The main characters are two twin girls, Angela and Diabola</text>, <text>Though they are twins, they are nothing alike</text>, <text>Angela is described as a wonderful child spreading joy and happiness wherever she goes</text>, <text>While Diabola, well, let's just say that she is the exact opposite of her sister in every way possible</text>, <text>Their parents had always been able to handle the girls, both the good and the bad, until one day when Diabola does something that neither her parents nor her sister would ever imagine</text>, <text>&lt;br&gt;\tAngela and Diabola is a great fiction book with wonderful dialogue and text</text>, <text>One thing that I really like about it is that the beginning jumps right into the story</text>, <text>The book really held my interest throughout the whole story</text>, <text>Anyone who has a good imagination and likes a great fiction book will enjoy this book</text>, <text>This book is about two sisters, Angela &amp; Diabola</text>, <text>Angela is sweet and she loves her sister dearly</text>, <text>Diabola is rotten and she hates her sister</text>, <text>She even strangled the cat! Their parents wanted to name them Jill &amp; Jane</text>, <text>But when the vicar saw them he named them Angela &amp; Diabola which  means angel &amp; devil</text>, <text>The only thing they have in common is they both  love to draw</text>, <text>This is the best book!</text>, <text>I don't think I understood the whole thing, but it's not all my fault</text>, <text>Deliberately author Michael Marshall splits up his story between the first person narration of ex-cop/coffee table book captionist Jack Whelan, with a variety of third person accounts that are purposely confusing and disparate, so that you need a second reading to be able to piece it all together properly</text>, <text>I kept skimming and skimming, thinking with my fingers crossed that \"this will all make sense later, I'm sure,\" but eventually I got at least a glimmer of a storyline involving a young nine year old girl who at first seems like she's been kidnapped by an evil, foul smelling man, but within a few pages we find out that this \"abduction\" is not really what it seems and the the 9 year old, cute little Madison, exhibits the cold, maniacal soullessness of an adult, and an especially demented one at that</text>, <text>But why?  Why?  Why?  She's like Patty McCormack in THE BAD SEED, but why?  Author Marshall has a new theory about why some kids hit the ground running, while others just go to the devil</text>, <text>He grabs your lapels and shakes this theory into you until you reach a point where you just want to slap his hands away, he's so insistent</text>, <text>On the home front, Jack is married to a woman who, just like in all the best postwar noir stories, isn't what she seems</text>, <text>This part of the story would seem more original if it hadn't been done just last month in the techno thriller HOOKED</text>, <text>Searching for the truth about his wife, Jack turns more and more to an old high school friend, Gary Fisher, once an idolized athletic hero in school, later a top lawyer, but obviously a man with a burning mission</text>, <text>As Jack grows suspicious of Amy, he grows closer and closer to Gary (who in the conventional thriller would have been a woman I think), and their eventual friendship and bonding has a distinct homoerotic charge to it as they both learn that women (and little girls) can't be trusted</text>, <text>Marshall makes you read through to the end but you'll be scratching your head over many of his plot choices, and I can't make up my mind whether the story is actually crazy stupid, or maybe too smart for a moron like myself</text>, <text>One of the &lt;B&gt;Mog the Cat&lt;/B&gt; Board Books</text>, <text>This book started off very good, but as it progressed it was incredibly boring i was basically falling asleep to it</text>, <text>The story has no story line, it isn't planned out well, the characters aren't described well and its mostly a narator telling the story</text>, <text>I would not suggest this book to anyone it was terrible!  I should be more careful when I pick up a book</text>, <text>I started it like 2 months ago and i haven't liked reading it, there are few events and it's as boring as heck, there's no good concept to it</text>, <text>In her book A History of the Wife, Marilyn Yalom traces the history and changing roles women have had in marriage from early history through the women's liberation movement</text>, <text>The Meaning of Wife picks up where that excellent book ends</text>, <text>It is clear from the cover of this book (a woman's left hand, flipping off the reader-with a perfectly manicured and wedding band-clad ring finger) that this is a book for a generation of women who are both used to confrontation and longing for tradition</text>, <text>It is this dichotomy in their lives that fuels the book</text>, <text>As women are working outside the home more, demanding more equitable treatment, and becoming market forces, they are also struggling to define what being a wife actually means to them</text>, <text>Kingston examines that many facets of wifeliness that seem to prevail: helpmeet, virgin, Cinderella (equally entranced by the wedding dress as she is of scented toilet bowl cleaner), victim of abuse, shrew, spinster (or unwife), or supporting actress</text>, <text>The main struggle for women now isn't whether or not to get married</text>, <text>Kingston is no Steinem and doesn't suggest that a woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle (though she is unmarried)</text>, <text>She acknowledges that women want to be wives and mothers</text>, <text>The problem is that they don't have role models</text>, <text>They have seen their mothers struggle to get out of the kitchen and are in no great rush to get back into it</text>, <text>Their icons growing up on TV were single women, Superwomen who could do it all by themselves</text>, <text>Popular culture, in the form of advertising, movies, books, news media, and television, is the most common source of clues to how women seek to describe themselves</text>, <text>Their icons now are very different</text>, <text>They see the brides, the yearning for marriage and a fairy tale wedding</text>, <text>Kingston excels and describing the marketing behind this notion (and I love that this industry now has an insidious name: the wedding industrial complex)</text>, <text>But once the marriage happens, there are a few very different ideas of what a married woman is</text>, <text>They see the happy homemaker</text>, <text>Though most have absolutely no desire to be homemakers, they still feel the pressure to have a well-kept home</text>, <text>A certain amount of bliss is marketed along with cleaning products</text>, <text>Or they are seen as the victim of love-the battered wife (an excellent chapter on the presentation of domestic abuse is given, including how it both infantilizes women and takes them back to Victorian times when women were seen to only follow their wombs, rather than brains, in decision making)</text>, <text>The main theme of this book is that there is not and cannot be one script for how to be a wife, just as there is no one role for husband</text>, <text>This is a well-written, researched, and balanced look at what marriage means now, not just wife</text>, <text>It isn't a reactionary or staunchly second-wave feminist look at marriage; Kingston respects marriage and the desire to be married</text>, <text>Excellent to read alongside A History of the Wife, The Mommy Myth: The Idealization of Motherhood and How It Has Undermined All Womenand Selling Anxiety: How the News Media Scare Women</text>, <text>The Keys to the Kingdom is an excellent new series by Garth Nix - a series I cannot wait for the sequel too! To get the concept of the book, you kind of have to read it, really</text>, <text>When Arthur is suffering from a asthma attack, two men appear to him, and one gives him a key shaped like the minute hand of an old clock</text>, <text>After that day, he starts seeing a large house</text>, <text>He is followed by creatures called Fetchers</text>, <text>Also, a book appears to him that is very useful</text>, <text>When a disease breaks out, he finds that it is spread by the Fetchers</text>, <text>Arthur sets off into the house to find a way to save his world</text>, <text>Angela and Diabola is one of my all-time favorite books</text>, <text>The story  is very interesting and will keep you riveted</text>, <text>Just to give you the basic story outline, there are twins born and one is angelic, the other like a little devil</text>, <text>The story is about how they cope with each other and how the people around cope with them</text>, <text>The ending is surprising and very good</text>, <text>Lynn Ried Banks twists good and evil into a compelling novel that 9 year olds and up will enjoy</text>, <text>At the end of the story, you will know the characters so well, you will wish there was a sequel!</text>, <text>I picked up this book mainly because of its cover not knowing that is was a non-fiction book</text>, <text>I almost didn't read it; I'm so glad I did</text>, <text>This book is not a man-bashing book but an uplifting book for women--or more or less a cautionairy tale</text>, <text>I thought at first that I'm not really a wife</text>, <text>I'm in a long-time (15 years) relationship--engaged but not really looking to get married</text>, <text>However, after reading this book, I realize I am a wife and do fall into the trap of some of the same wifely aspects</text>, <text>I already recommened this book to a colleague who is several years younger and would recommend it to all young women and men</text>, <text>In this first book in the series, Keys to the Kingdom, we find Aurther Penhaligon, a seventh grader who recently moved to a new and strange home</text>, <text>Of, course, it doesn't seem strange to him- at first</text>, <text>Aurther has heavy asthma, which places him in the hospital quite often</text>, <text>One Monday morining, Aurther is in Gym in his new shcool, and has an asthma attck on the run they were on</text>, <text>During this attack, A strangfe man named Mister Monday comes, and is tricked into giving Aurther a minute hand shaped \"key\"- which is what they called it</text>, <text>As soon as Aurther holds this key, he finds that he can breathe, and he doesn't die the death that he was meant to die</text>, <text>&lt;br&gt;     But with this key comes strange creatures from another dimension who pursue the key, and though he doesn't know why, Aurther knows that he shouldn't give it to them{they work for Mister Monday- who wants the key back}</text>, <text>These creatures, called Fetchers bring a terrible disease called the \"Sleepy Pluage\", which after afew symtoms like having a cold, puts the infected people to sleep- literally- they fall asleep, and can't be woken up! Aurther is particually sensitive to this outbreak beacuse he is adopted{his birth parents died in a flu outbreak when he was a baby}</text>, <text>He couldn't bear to have more loved ones lost to a disease outbreak</text>, <text>&lt;br&gt;    Then, Aurther notices a strange house that only he can see</text>, <text>He has a feeling that the answer to curing the sick people is to go in there</text>, <text>But what he finds when he does is a another world, calle the House, which was created by the Great Architect- the creator of all things</text>, <text>&lt;br&gt;     This aerchitect left long ago, but left a will to be followed through- BUT IT WAS NOT!!! The will was broken in seven fragments, and scattered through time and space</text>, <text>Now the first and least fragment of the Will has escaped, and it is helping Aurther</text>, <text>It says that he is the rightfull heir to the kingdom{the House} but all Aurther wants is a cure to the Sleepy Plauge</text>, <text>The Will tells Aurther that to find this cure, he has to defeat Mister Monday, using the Minute Hand key, and claim Mondays half of the key {the Hour Hand}which will then bind with the Minute Hand to become the first and leat Key to the Kingdom</text>, <text>Aurther, Suzy Blue{a friend he makes on the way} and the Will now will go through many treacherous tasks to defeat Monday- the Will so that Aurther can claim the key, therefore the first part of the Will is done, Aurther to find a cure to thing strange plauge, and Suzy to help them all</text>, <text>I thought that this book was amazing, had great detail, and was imaginative in every way</text>, <text>Garth Nix did a great job, and I can't wait to read Grim Tuesday, the next book in the Keys to the Kingdom series!</text>, <text>This book is about a boy named, Arthur, who recieves a key and an atlas from a mysterious man named Mister Monday</text>, <text>Later that week a plague hits the town, Arthur has to unravel the mysteries of the key to save his family and friends</text>, <text>This is a great book, I can't wait to read the second book in this series, Grim Tuesday</text>, <text>Garth Nix has become my new favorite writer, and my discovery started with Mister Monday, the first in the Keys to the Kingdom series</text>, <text>This opening episode introduces us to Arthur, a displaced but sharp young boy in his first days at a new school</text>, <text>When a distanced run in gym class brings on a devastating asthma attack, Arthur is supposed to die</text>, <text>Because he doesn't, he is thrust into a world he never knew existed, with the fate of all worlds in his hands</text>, <text>Having now read Sabriel, the first in Nix's earlier young adult series, The Abhorsen Trilogy, I can see how far he's come as a writer</text>, <text>Keys to the Kingdom is superbly paced, and with each new book, we learn a little more about the bigger picture</text>, <text>The arc of the stories is huge, but strongly anchored in the characters and Nix's attention to details</text>, <text>Just a note about editions:  I collect books, and while paperbacks are available and cost a little less than the hardcovers, the hardcover editions of these books are very sharp looking on the shelf</text>, <text>They're colorful and really stand out in a larger collection</text>, <text>I have to say, I haven't read anything yet by Garth Nix that I didn't enjoy, but Mister Monday is by far my favorite</text>, <text>The opening few pages hooked me, and I'm now three books in, anxiously awaiting number four, Sir Thursday, coming out around March!</text>, <text>Exploding onto the Childrens' Literature scene is Garth Nix and his Keys to the Kingdom series</text>, <text>Mister Monday commences the series, with Arthur inhereting a strange key in the shape of a minute hand from a clock</text>, <text>With this strange weapon, he enters into a house only he can see to save his world from a pandemic</text>, <text>He must confont the sloth Mister Monday in order to gain mastery of the lower house and save his world</text>, <text>Jack Whalen, a retired L</text>, <text>A</text>, <text>cop now living in rural Washington state, whose background may be a little murky, is surprised by a visit from a high school semi-buddy who wants his help with a murdered family and a disappeared husband who may have been onto some highly secretive organization</text>, <text>Jack is reluctant to help until his own wife disappears while supposedly on a business trip to Seattle, and he learns that she may be involved with the same company the missing man was investigating/working with</text>, <text>When Jack's wife Amy reappears as if nothing is wrong but begins to act just a little bit \"not Amy,\" he finds himself in an uneasy team with the old buddy, Fisher, trying to ferret out the truth behind a shadowy group whose members seem to be hiding some truly strange things</text>, <text>There is also a concurrent subplot, quite connected to the larger plot, involving a 9 year old girl who also goes missing but finds herself doing and thinking things far beyond her young capabilities, much to her confusion</text>, <text>The noir style of writing in Jack's portions of the narrative are wonderful and cleverly hard-boiled</text>, <text>Marshall throws in a bit of the supernatural and even SciFi, but the character of Jack and his determined progress keep this tale grounded firmly on the personal issues</text>, <text>I was afraid the book would veer into some \"it's all aliens!\" territory, but its focus stays earthbound, and the dramatic tensions build nicely to its climax, with a smooth denouement that makes sense</text>, <text>I read this book when I was 12 and I read it at least once a year since then</text>, <text>Each time I read it I remember what it was like to be an akward teen going through the angst of my senior year</text>, <text>I've had friends like Liz and Sean and I was a Maggie once myself</text>, <text>The book is about this kid whose name is authur</text>, <text>He gets caught in all this mess about trying to get a key from this guy whose name is Mister Monday</text>, <text>but before he can do that he has to dodge fechters, run from enemys like Noon and Dawn, run from dinosaurs, try not to get killed, and try to prevent himself from having a asthma atackk!! But, thankfully he has some help from a girl named suzy, a guy named Dusk, and a talking toad</text>, <text>So now, he shoulden't have nothing to worry about, right?</text>, <text>I think this is a very good book that answers the many questions of young adults as they are faced with them</text>, <text>I recommend this book to anyone and everyone</text>, <text>It's just plain good!</text>, <text>Hey readers</text>, <text>Are you ready to embark on an unforgettable journey into the mysterious House occupied by cruel rulers and miserable children? In this book, Sir Monday: The keys to the Kingdom, Garth Nix develops a new spicy taste in literature that brings in a modern view of adventure</text>, <text>Think about all the classics you've ever read in your life like To Kill a Mockingbird or Harry Potter</text>, <text>Why have these books been chosen for numerous rewards and prizes?

Wow!  That choice totally ruins the book</text>, <text>His attempt at an English accent is laughable</text>, <text>I couldn't finish it and I usually love Val McDermid's work</text>, <text>Guess I'll have to get a paper copy</text>, <text>Though not a fan of fantasy, I do read it occasionally to keep up on what my students are reading</text>, <text>The richly imagined descriptions in this series made it one that I enjoyed reading</text>, <text>An asthmatic seventh grade boy, Arthur Penhaligan, is the hero for this seven book fantasy</text>, <text>Handicapped and with the odds always against him, he does not give up trying to do what's right</text>, <text>A rich stew of surreal Alice in Wonderland-type imagery and characters, elements reminiscent of myths, an alternate universe, endless hair's breadth escapes, grisly horror, and mystery, Keys to the Kingdom never lags</text>, <text>However, this series is not just a vividly imagined movie in print for a happy reader to follow</text>, <text>Keys to the Kingdom is a thinking kid's fantasy</text>, <text>If one pays close enough attention, answers to the great questions of the origins of our world and our human natures might come close to being answered</text>, <text>Well-liked by both boys and girls in my middle school classes, this series is favored by boys; and though written at a seventh grade reading level, is also well-liked by high school boys into about tenth grade</text>, <text>The interest level is rated at grade five through eight</text>, <text>Both the complexity of the plot and the at times nightmare-like imagery may keep this from being a book for fifth grade and under, unless a child in these years is looking to be challenged and a little frightened</text>, <text>The series starts with Mister Monday and moves through each day of the week: Grim Tuesday, Drowned Wednesday, Sir Thursday, Lady Friday, Superior Saturday, and the eagerly awaited and yet un-named Sunday episode</text>, <text>Gaby Chapman</text>, <text>MISTER MONDAY is the first in a new series by Garth Nix, author of THE SEVENTH TOWER</text>, <text>Well paces and written for it's intended audience, younger readers, it weaves a spell binding story of reluctant heroes and less than evil villains</text>, <text>The young protagonist; Arthur Penhaligon, is chosen by the Will (the last instructions from the Great Architect, read God, before she takes off to places unknown,) to be the heir of the Keys to the Kingdom, to be the master of the House and the known universe</text>, <text>Problem is he's in the seventh grade and doesn't want to rule the world, all he wants to do is save his family and friends from a plague let lose by the same forces who don't want him to succeed, principally Mr</text>, <text>Monday, one of the seven trusties entrusted with the Will while GA is off gallivanting about</text>, <text>Although a lot of the characters, ok most of the characters, are rather bizarre the one that stands out in this sea of strangeness is Arthur</text>, <text>Throughout the story Arthur, even though given one of the keys to the universe, remains little more than a boy, a seventh grade boy</text>, <text>No superhero, no genius, just a boy who's forced to do something he really doesn't want to do</text>, <text>Written slightly below the level of the Harry Potter books this series should still capture the attention and imagination of young readers attracted to these types of stories</text>, <text>I found it to be a fun and enchanting read, maybe a little tame, but then I'm somewhat older than the target audience</text>, <text>I would certainly RECOMMEND this book to all the young readers out there, and even a few of the older ones</text>, <text>When Guzzler Gummidge wishes on an old lamp, he becomes invisible</text>, <text>At first he is very excited, but he's less pleased when he discovers that he might have to stay invisible forever</text>, <text>The story is read by Harry Enfield</text>, <text>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;P style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"&gt;Do you take a tent to the jungle?

Are they ready for sex?  Meanwhile can Maggie and Dennis learn to communicate enough to stay together?</text>, <text>This book is Paul Zindel's second and was first published way back in 1969</text>, <text>Life has changed since then, such as the free availability of legal abortion, but much of the story is still surprisingly relevant to modern life</text>, <text>Liz and Maggie are the main characters so this could be described as a book for girls, but the lives of Sean and Dennis are also described in important sub-plots</text>, <text>The story is basically a double romance but Zindel has too much of a grip on the ugliness of life to describe the book as 'romantic</text>, <text>'  This is not Mills and Boon stuff</text>, <text>To tell the truth I find this novel one of Zindel's less successful works</text>, <text>To my mind there is nothing in the story to make it really memorable</text>, <text>But then again Zindel is so far above other writers that I would certainly still recommend reading the novel</text>, <text>I should also add that I am largely interested in coming of age stories about boys, so maybe I am biased</text>, <text>I have been reading Agatha Christie and especially Poirot for last 10 years</text>, <text>After reading nearly 30 novels, Poirot had been a part of life</text>, <text>And the feeling of not seeing or hearing Poirot any more felt as if I have lost a close friend</text>, <text>I never knew Agatha Christie could bring so much of emotion</text>, <text>I'll rate this novel the third best I have read only after Murder of Roger Ackryod and Murder on Orient Express</text>, <text>I finished the novel last night and found it hard to sleep after that</text>, <text>Its too good</text>, <text>Finally we saw the perfect murderer, who did not do anything to be found guilty of murder</text>, <text>The flow was smooth and being the last case of Poirot, you are tempted to suspect everybody in it</text>, <text>In fact this novel should be read after you have read a substantial number of Agatha Christies</text>, <text>Hastings keeps on giving references to past cases</text>, <text>In one sentence I can sum it up as it was a wonderful and nostalgic experience going through the pages</text>, <text>A MUST READ</text>, <text>Very enjoyable</text>, <text>Depth of story keeps you interested all the way to the end</text>, <text>David Guterson's first novel, Snow Falling on Cedars,  was a true ensemble piece, in which even a high-stakes murder trial seemed  like a judgment passed on the community at large</text>, <text>In his eloquent second  novel, however, the author swings dramatically in the opposite direction</text>, <text>East of the Mountains is the tale of a solitary, 73-year-old Seattle  widower</text>, <text>A retired heart surgeon, Ben Givens is an old hand at turning  isolation to his advantage, both professionally and personally: \"When  everything human was erased from existence except that narrow antiseptic  window through which another's heart could be manipulated--few were as  adroit as Dr</text>, <text>Givens</text>, <text>\"    Now, however, Ben has been dealt a problem entirely beyond his powers of  manipulation: a diagnosis of terminal cancer</text>, <text>With just a few months to  live, he sets out across the Cascades for a hunting trip, planning to take  his own life once he reaches the high desert</text>, <text>A car crash en route puts an  initial crimp in this suicide mission</text>, <text>But the ailing surgeon presses  onward--and begins a simultaneous journey into the past</text>, <text>Between  present-tense episodes, which demonstrate Ben's cranky commitment to his  own extinction, we learn about his boyhood in Washington's apple country,  his traumatic war experience in the Italian Alps, and the beginning of his  vocation</text>, <text>Guterson narrates the apple-scented idyll of Ben's childhood in a typically  low-key manner--and orchards, of course, are seldom the stuff of melodrama</text>, <text>Still, many of his ambling sentences offer miniature lessons in patience  and perception: \"They rode back all day to the Columbia, traversed it on  the Colockum Ferry, and at dusk came into their orchard tired, on empty  stomachs, their hats tipped back, to walk the horses between the rows of  trees in a silent kind of processional, and Aidan ran his hands over limbs  as he passed them with his horse behind him, the limbs trembling in the  wake of his passing, and on, then, to the barn</text>, <text>\" The wartime episodes,  however, are less satisfactory</text>, <text>Clearly Guterson has done his research down  to the last stray bullet, but there's a second-hand feeling to the  material, which seems less a token of Ben's detachment than the  author's</text>, <text>There is, alas, an additional problem</text>, <text>Begin a story with a planned  suicide, and there are exactly two possible outcomes</text>, <text>It would be unfair to  reveal Ben's fate</text>, <text>But as the forces of life and death yank him one way,  then another, Guterson tends to stack the deck--particularly during a bus  ride toward the end of the novel, when Ben's fellow passengers appear to  have wandered in from a Frank Capra film</text>, <text>Yet East of the Mountains  remains a beautifully imagined work, in which the landscape reflects both  Ben's desperation and his intermittent delight</text>, <text>And Guterson knows from the  start what his protagonist learns in painful increments: that \"a neat,  uncomplicated end\" doesn't exist on either side of the mountains</text>, <text>--James Marcus</text>, <text>As a 7th grade teacher I have discovered that Garth Nix's Keys to the Kingdom series is a fabulous read aloud for my students</text>, <text>The suspense and amazing imagination that Nix uses draws the students in and keeps them hooked from page one</text>, <text>I noticed that my students often began reading book two before I was done reading book one because they were so anxious to find out what happened to Arthur!  I would recommend this book for anyone who values the amazing capabilities of the imagination</text>, <text>Mr</text>, <text>Monday allows you to get wrapped up in a world that is both strange and familiar and is a wonderful reading experience</text>, <text>Smashing success</text>, <text>Carol Jordan entices  Tony Hill to join with  Dutch and German Detectives to try and capture a serial killer that drowns his victims then scalps their pubic hair for his collection</text>, <text>Not one to avoid the grisly,  McDermid provides plenty in this fast paced thriller-mystery that follows two stories, Jordan's attempt to con a notorious drug and human smuggling crime boss in Germany  and the serial killer who moves between Holland And Germany with ease to dispatch his victims</text>, <text>Jordan and Hill seem to have overcome their personal problems that kept them apart in previous mysteries but a vicious twist at the end portends a troubled future for them</text>, <text>Excellent plotting and character development</text>, <text>A joy to read</text>, <text>This is probably the grittiest of the Tony Hill/Carol Jordan stories and one of the best</text>, <text>Carol goes undercover in Europe to catch an international criminal and both she and Tony nearly lose their lives as a result</text>, <text>They both begin to acknowledge their feelings for each other but before it can go very far, events take over and in some ways, they end up even farther apart than they were before</text>, <text>This is not a story for the squeamish</text>, <text>There is quite a bit of brutal reality and a rape too terrible to even think about, but Val McDermid has created characters and a story that I just couldn't put down</text>, <text>It left me anxious to read the next book in the series</text>, <text>I loved this book it was very good</text>, <text>:)I though I was in it the book the detales were almost real</text>, <text>It got me more into books</text>, <text>Then I was ever befor I read or seen this book</text>, <text>Many writers of historical fiction start with an actual event in history, and then let their imaginations run free</text>, <text>This fascinating book shows great imaginative restraint</text>, <text>Certainly there are fictional threads running through the tale, but Mr</text>, <text>Dobbs seriously wants to tell us about Neville Chamberlain's politics of appeasement, a policy that ended with his downfall as Prime Minister</text>, <text>Throughout the book we are a fly on the wall listening to the political machinations of the principle characters in the story which include, Chamberlain, Churchill, Ambassador Joseph Kennedy, Lord Halifax, the traitor Guy Burgess, and many others</text>, <text>It is fascinating to see Chamberlain's party struggle to hold on as their political capital steadily declined</text>, <text>Churchill, on the other hand starts as an outcast, one who continually cries out that peace with Hitler is an unattainable goal</text>, <text>His rise to First Lord of the Admiralty, and then to Prime Minister is a long fight against the odds</text>, <text>I am a history buff who's read books on WWII and English history, and this book taught me many things that I didn't know</text>, <text>Now I've said that this book fascinated me, the almost 700 pages just sped by, but I must say that this book may not be everybody's cup of tea</text>, <text>It definitely is not a wartime thriller</text>, <text>The novel is full of conversation, and as for action you'll have to settle for walks through the garden of Buckingham Palace with Lord Halifax, and King George VI (who, we find out, was so tongue tied that it was difficult for him to make clear statements)</text>, <text>Angela and Diabola is about two sisters, one very angelic, and one very, very diabolic</text>, <text>The book starts out with Mrs</text>, <text>Cuthbertson-Jones, their mother, giving birth to the twins</text>, <text>Angela comes out very peacefully and doesn't cry afterwards, but Diabola comes out kicking and screaming and almost bites the nurse's finger off</text>, <text>The girls grow up into toddlers and Diabola becomes even worse while Angela became sweeter</text>, <text>When the twins are six they begin school</text>, <text>Angela is very excited, but Diabola is bored and gloomy</text>, <text>Then Diabola draws a horrid picture, and the principal thinks Diabola is a genius</text>, <text>Diabola then starts to love school, and especially drawing</text>, <text>The principal only starts to doubt that Diabola is a genius when she burns down the school building</text>, <text>After that Diabola starts acting even more diabolic</text>, <text>She acts so badly that Mr</text>, <text>Cuthbertson-Jones leaves and abandons his family</text>, <text>Diabola also discovers that she has powers where she can set things on fire, which is how she burned the school down</text>, <text>With these new powers, she burns her house down too</text>, <text>The Cuthbertson-Joneses have to move into a run down apartment</text>, <text>Diabola does many mean but funny things</text>, <text>Read the book and find out what she does!             I think this book is hilarious</text>, <text>It is also rather emotional at times, though, for instance when Angela encounters these weird feelings where she feels she must be near Diabola</text>, <text>My favorite part is when Diabola and Mrs</text>, <text>Cuthbertson-Jones are in the kitchen in their apartment and men come in and try to steal all their food</text>, <text>Diabola becomes mad and uses her powers to make their eyes sting</text>, <text>Mrs</text>, <text>Cuthbertson-Jones thinks Diabola hurt the men for her, but really Diabola didn't like the men and had done it for herself</text>, <text>My least favorite part is when Mr</text>, <text>Cuthbertson-Jones leaves his wife to handle the twins</text>, <text>A ngela becomes really emotional when her dad sends her letters</text>, <text>&lt;br&gt;             I really liked this book and would recommend it to anyone who likes books about the good and the dark side of life</text>, <text>Anyone who likes Harry Potter would like this book because it is about fighting and neutralizing evil people</text>, <text>Angela and Diabola is a great book and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a funny novel</text>, <text>Anne Kingston did a marvellous job on this book</text>, <text>The book is a social commentary and observation about how wifedom has (and has not) changed over the years</text>, <text>The historical aspect is educational and the various topics explored in this book has opened my eyes to the little things I take for granted every day</text>, <text>For instance, as everyone knows, diamonds are merely super-polished carbon</text>, <text>The diamond industry would like people to believe they are rare but they really aren't and that a prominent diamond company basically created a market for diamond engagement rings so they can kill two birds with one stone: (1) sell the product they have in abundance, and (2) make a killing by setting exorbitant prices! Besides the wedding industry, Kingston also writes about issues such as divorce and child-rearing, synthesizing together information from many books and articles</text>, <text>This is a must-read for all, whether you're a wife or a non-wife!</text>, <text>An very cute book for the young child</text>, <text>Great for the cat or animal lover</text>, <text>Author of \"Hobo Finds A Home\"</text>, <text>Arthur Penhaligon lives in a world that closely resembles our own - in fact may be our own in the near future</text>, <text>A deadly flu pandemic killed his parents when he was  a baby and also apparently allowed the federal government to assume sweeping powers, and his adoptive mother is a medical researcher</text>, <text>An asthmatic, Arthur suffers an attack when in gym class at his new school, and while he is waiting for medical assistance, two strangely garbed men give him what appears to be the minute hand of a clock</text>, <text>This simple action changes his life for good</text>, <text>Arthur now becomes the target of increasingly frightening attacks by mysterious men, some with faces that resemble dogs, and a new illness known as the \"sleepy plague\" appears in his town</text>, <text>He eventually finds his way into a bizarre realm known as the House, which turns out to be, essentially, the \"Command and Control\" center for the rest of the universe</text>, <text>He also learns that after creating the universe from Nothing (which is an actual substance in this \"mythology\"), the Architect mysteriously departed, leaving a will in the hands of seven trustees, the Morrow Days, who have become corrupt and are now running things to suit themselves</text>, <text>However, the first part of the Will, which is a living entity, has escaped and engineered the transfer of part of Monday's Key (the minute hand) into the possession of a mortal, Arthur, who is now the Architect's Heir</text>, <text>Arthur's only hope, if he is to survive and stop the plague in his own world, is to obtain the rest of the Key from Mister Monday and accept his status as Heir, however little he wants it</text>, <text>Garth Nix's originality, while not of the same type as Philip Pullman's, never ceases to amaze me</text>, <text>He also possesses a certain sly humor and, like Pullman and J</text>, <text>K</text>, <text>Rowling, makes numerous allusions to literary, mythical and cultural traditions far and wide</text>, <text>In the House, Arthur encounters Suzy Turquoise Blue, a cheeky Cockney girl from the 17th century of his own world and one of the \"Piper's Children\"; the personified Will itself in the form of a tiny frog with a penchant for jumping down people's throats; the \"Old One,\" whose identity should be obvious to anyone with an interest in classical mythology, and assorted other Denizens</text>, <text>Arthur is a sympathetic but flawed character and Nix, without preaching or moralizing, manages to portray his compassion and a strong sense of right and wrong that truly make him worthy to be the Architect's Heir</text>, <text>Suzy, although a secondary character, is brave and resourceful as well as funny, and without her, Arthur probably would not have survived his first hour in the House</text>, <text>The Will, both in frog and human form, is wonderfully quirky and cranky, and even Mister Monday turns out not to be irredeemable</text>, <text>As with a lot of the best young adult books out there, some kids may find this series disturbing, and there are some scenes that contain a certain amount of violence</text>, <text>Mr</text>, <text>Monday is interesting enough but to really enjoy you have to continue the series</text>, <text>I love Garth Nix's books but I did find Mr</text>, <text>Monday a little less interesting than the rest of his books</text>, <text>I finished the book and didn't really feel inclined to start the next one but when I did I couldn't stop reading</text>, <text>I went from book to book until I finished Lady Friday which had just been released that week</text>, <text>I spent the full $17 at Borders because I couldn't wait for the paper back or for the cheaper version to ship from amazon</text>, <text>The reason Mr</text>, <text>Monday is kinda of slow compared to the others in the series is because it is setting up the series and characters</text>, <text>It's a lot of information that informs and confuses at the same time</text>, <text>Like most of Nix's book series if you don't read the entire series you don't get all the questions answered</text>, <text>My advice to those interested in this series is A) read further after finishing this book and B) For those of you who prefer to ready fantasy that is based in this reality but has a twist to it (like Vampires, Werewolves, Harry Potter, etc</text>, <text>) then stay away from this series because it beyond your imagination</text>, <text>This is the best book ever better than Grim Tuesday and Drowned Wednesday although they were really good too</text>, <text>I even changed my name to Mister Monday!!!!!!!!!</text>, <text>We purchased the audiobook version of this book</text>, <text>It was an interesting story that my 8 yo loved, but my 6 yo was somewhat frightened by it(and he's not frightened by much lately)</text>, <text>The characters are very interesting,  deeply drawn and the relationship between the \"good\" twin  (Angela) &amp;

And the first Harry Potter book was very firmly a middle-grade novel, despite its length</text>, <text>Amazon</text>, <text>com rates its readership the same as for Mister Monday--ages 9-12, which would be about right</text>, <text>I call that the upper end of the middle-grade readership</text>, <text>Too many books suitable for this age group are classed as \"young adult\"--possibly because the readership of YA books is more likely to be 15 and under than genuine young adults, and many young readers like to feel they are reading above their age level, so authors and publishers pander to this</text>, <text>I do know that at age 15 I wouldn't have \"been seen dead\" reading a children's book because, even though 15-year-olds of my generation were considerably less sophisticated than today's 15-year-olds, I considered myself \"too old--nearly grown up\"</text>, <text>Make what you like of that</text>, <text>:-)</text>, <text>The wife and teenage son of a Seattle-area scientist are brutally murdered by a stranger claiming to be an FBI agent, and the scientist himself is nowhere to be found</text>, <text>A short time later, a nine-year-old girl named Madison disappears from Oregon's ethereal Cannon Beach while her inattentive mother, despondent over the deteriorating state of her marriage, dozes inside their beach cottage</text>, <text>But the tale of The Intruders truly begins when Jack Whalen, a former cop with a troubled past who has of late become an accidental author of sorts, gets an out-of-the-blue visit from Gary Fisher, a high school classmate he hasn't seen in two decades, and one to whom he was only mildly acquainted -- making the seemingly impromptu reunion even more suspicious to a been-there-done-that kind of guy like Jack</text>, <text>Fisher, now a lawyer teetering precariously on the brink of something he himself is struggling to understand, has ostensibly come to ask for Jack's opinion on an estate case he's handling, owing to Jack's past in law enforcement and their connection as former classmates</text>, <text>But, as always, there's much more to the story</text>, <text>Fisher's re-entrance into Jack's life is the catalyst for massive change, and the chaos that has been loitering outside the Whalen home for the last few years has finally found its way inside</text>, <text>Suddenly, everything Jack thinks he knows about his life is being challenged, especially in regard to his ad-executive wife, Amy, whose recent behavior has become increasingly peculiar</text>, <text>Except for overuse of the words \"diffident\" and \"irresolute\" (a nitpick, to be sure), The Intruders succeeds as a thoroughly gripping and surprising creepy tale -- although, in the end, it left me with more questions than answers</text>, <text>I wanted to learn more about the Nine, a secret organization central to the tale's mystery, and was left feeling a bit confused about certain key points to the story (namely a character who goes unidentified until the end)</text>, <text>Plus, I wasn't satisfied with the resolution between Jack and Amy, and thought it was a bit anticlimactic</text>, <text>And yet, that aside, The Intruders captivated me from the first horrifying chapter -- so much so, that I read it all in one night</text>, <text>The Intruders is a tale that will appeal to readers who want an engrossing thriller with other-worldly tones</text>, <text>If you're geeky, as I am, then many of the ideas in the book will resonate with that part of you that believes -- or wants to -- in the things that go bump in the night</text>, <text>Just know that, whereas some books are a veritable feast for the mind that leave you filled to capacity for days, The Intruders is more like a frozen dinner: tasty, but not that satisfying</text>, <text>If you have any affection for Tony Hill and Carol Jordan as created by Val McDermid, don't read this book</text>, <text>I read \"The Mermaids Singing\" and was enthralled, but this one was a big disappointment</text>, <text>The plot involving the serial killer is shallow and seems tacked on</text>, <text>The real plot involves Carol, her relationship with Tony, and a sting operation that is completely unbelievable</text>, <text>The ending is a depressing let-down</text>, <text>Overall, the book is a big mess</text>, <text>Avoid it</text>, <text>In two weeks, Will Martin's father will be hanged for murder unless 14-year-old Will can prove his innocence</text>, <text>He has a slim chance in the form of a 75-year-old parrot who may know the real killer</text>, <text>Will sets out on his mission, but soon becomes a target himself</text>, <text>The only chance he has to save both himself and his father is to unlock the secret--and the curse--of Devil's Lake</text>, <text>I have read all of the Poirot stories, and this is by far my favorite</text>, <text>Not only is it the perfect second bookend to the Poirot series (since the first Poirot story also took place at Styles), it is also the most intricate and brilliant of the Poirot stories</text>, <text>I have read Agatha Christie all of my life</text>, <text>I am usually able to pick up on some of her clues and figure out who the murderer might be</text>, <text>I confess, with this one, I could not</text>, <text>I loved re-reading it to discover the clues I had missed</text>, <text>The concept of the murderer who is brilliant enough to manipulate others into doing the job for him is extremely interesting</text>, <text>I wonder if Agatha Christie decided to kill off Poirot because she knew she could never write anything better than this</text>, <text>I believe this is the best of the best</text>, <text>I'm off to read it yet again</text>, <text>This book was a page-turner that I didn't want to put down</text>, <text>Granted, it was  dense enough to be on a college syllabus, but so many of the anecdotes rang true</text>, <text>If you only have time to read one chapter, read chapter 2 \"Heart of Whiteness\" about the wedding industry</text>, <text>Actually, though, you probably won't be able to resist reading the entire book</text>, <text>I'm not quite done with this book yet, but I have to say, I like it</text>, <text>I've read his last three books and I liked them all too</text>, <text>If you were a fan of \"The Traveler\" and \"Dark River\" and also the \"Perfect Dark\" books written by Greg Rucka (based on the video game) you should definitely check out this book</text>, <text>Marshall takes his time putting out new novels, but it's always worth the wait</text>, <text>Read it</text>, <text>Now</text>, <text>Although, I would give it **** not the 5 it has above, they wouldn't let me go back and change it</text>, <text>For this new series of book, Garth Nix obviously had a younger public in mind than for his best selling Abhorsen trilogy</text>, <text>The plot is simpler, the protagonist is younger and the language is easier</text>, <text>Difficult words are being explained</text>, <text>Having said that, this must be an absolute thrill to read when you're nine or ten</text>, <text>It puts an ordinary boy in charge of the Center of the Universe, if just for the Monday, and which ordinary boy wouldn't think that a very attractive idea?</text>, <text>It's a story about adventure, but also about responsibility, and courage, and overall I could recommend it to any boy or girl, and their parents, to read it!</text>, <text>Now, I had read all of the Seventh Tower Books before this book came out, so I knew that Garth Nix was a good author</text>, <text>I saw the book and said \" Hey, Cool, He wrote a new book!\" This book was excellent, and brilliantly written</text>, <text>I would give it 30 thumbs up if I could! This book starts off with the main character, Arthur, going to a new school</text>, <text>on his first day of school, he is surprised by a mandatory run</text>, <text>He tries to jog and run for a while, but he is azhmatic and faints whle he is running</text>, <text>Then, a mysteriuos man called mister Monday gives him a key, with the thought that he would die any second</text>, <text>But the key altered his \"record\" and he lived, to the surprise of Mister Monday</text>, <text>That is where the adventure begins</text>, <text>That's all I'm going to say for now, but this is an awesome book, and its worth more than what they sell it for</text>, <text>I hope this review helps in your decision</text>, <text>I read this book because it was on my reading list and because my mom had read it when she was in school</text>, <text>I really liked this book and I read it all in one night</text>, <text>This book had some mature subject matter that young kids should not read</text>, <text>For the most part, I thought this book was good and I especially enjoyed Maggie and Dennis</text>, <text>Garth Nix really glued my eyes to this book for hours! I couldn't stop reading all day! His book Mister Monday tells the story of young Arthur Penhaligon's adventure into the House</text>, <text>While at school Arthur obtains a \"Key\" shaped like a minute hand on a clock</text>, <text>In the never-ending height of the House, he is the rightful heir to the lower part</text>, <text>The only problem is that the other hand of the clock is owned by the old ruler, who doesn't want to give it away</text>, <text>Meanwhile the first section of the \"Will\" the creator of everything left behind, has escaped from it's highly secured prison on a dead star</text>, <text>Although The only reason Arthur is in this adventure is so he can save the world from the plague the \"Key\" brought with it</text>, <text>Garth Nix can build one idea off of the other, which would help him explain his thoughts</text>, <text>For example, when Arthur is in an elevator with the \"Will\" and Suzy Turquoise Blue, (They are going to the 379th floor, so they have the time) Garth Nix explained everything about the plague Arthur wants to cure</text>, <text>So basically the author took the opportunity to explain all the confusing parts in the book up to that point</text>, <text>I personally love fantasy books, and Garth nix can draw people like me into his writing</text>, <text>He has things relating to time, space, extremely tall houses that can slow time the moment you touch it</text>, <text>Stuff like that!</text>, <text>I loved this book, so I probably am going to read the next books in this series:</text>, <text>#2 - Grim Tuesday</text>, <text>#3 - Drowned Wednesday</text>, <text>#4 - Sir Thursday</text>, <text>Coming Soon</text>, <text>#5 - Lady Friday</text>, <text>#6 - Superior Saturday</text>, <text>#7 - Lord Sunday</text>, <text>Will Arthur save the world from the plague? How did the \"Will\" escape? Read Mister Monday and all those questions will be answered!</text>, <text>Published during the 1950s, the author's stereotyped attitudes towards native peoples is all to readily apparent, including the names he gives some of the stitches</text>, <text>Some of the pictures are very painful, taken together with the narrative</text>, <text>This is NOT a lost art here, people, &amp; there are Native artists producing both traditional &amp; contemporary beadwork that easily rivals the work of our grandparents</text>, <text>There are much better, more contemporary sources available now</text>, <text>This is ok only as a curiosity from an earlier decade</text>, <text>My Darling,My Hambuger is a well written novel by Paul Zindel that might illustrtate the life of a teen durign hi high school years</text>, <text>This novel focuses on four teens and the struggles they go through while growing up</text>, <text>Paul focuses on the problems of an intimate relationship and the decisions  the teens make at that moment</text>, <text>While this book explores issues of teens I  highly recommend it to others</text>, <text>This novel focuses on the issue of sex and  it helps teenagers understand how complicated it gets if the teenager  decides to develope a intimid relationship</text>, <text>The novel ilustrates how some  parents ignore this issue and it also mentions how some parents deal with  it</text>, <text>Overall this novel is very interesting and short</text>, <text>Paul really  emphasizes what sex can lead to and at the same time gets into teenagers  head to really think about doing things out before executing them</text>, <text>Even  though this book is mainy aim at teenagers in American cultureparents and  others culture can relate to them</text>, <text>The story gives hidden messages about  how a parent can help a teen age son or daughter instead of ignoring them</text>, <text>From a bestselling novelist with an unrivalled insight into the workings of power comes a compelling new novel exploring Winston Churchill's remarkable journey from the wilderness to No 10 Downing Street at the beginning of World War II</text>, <text>Saturday 1 October 1938</text>, <text>Two men meet</text>, <text>One is elderly, the other in his twenties</text>, <text>One will become the most revered man of his time, and the other known as the greatest of traitors</text>, <text>Winston Churchill met Guy Burgess at a moment when the world was about to explode</text>, <text>Now in is astonishing new novel, Michael Dobbs throws brilliant fresh light upon Churchill's relationship with the Soviet spy and the twenty months of conspiracy, chance and outright treachery that were to propel Churchill from outcast to messiah and change the course of history</text>, <text>I just could not put this book down</text>, <text>I loved how Angela was loved by  every one and No one liked Dioblo</text>, <text>It is amazing how Lynne Ried Banks put  you into the book</text>, <text>She makes it feel likek you are right there watching  this all happen</text>, <text>This book is different then the ohter books I read by  her but this book was the best</text>, <text>When I took the first look at the cover I  knew that it would be an wonderfull book</text>, <text>this is one of the best books i  have read in the last year or so</text>, <text>If you are looking for a thrilling mystery, this is the book for you! This book is about an asmatic boy who has moved to a new school and the first day has a asma attack</text>, <text>In having this attach Arthur Penhaligon meets two new friends (Leaf and Ed twin brother and sister) and also gets a suprise, Mister Monday and his buttler, Sneezer, appear with a flash of light and give Arthur a gift,(Arthur thinks Sneezer is up to something but does not know) a minute hand of a clock (the clock that was guarding the will) and a book (An Atlas he can't yet open)</text>, <text>Arhtur does not know this but a will guarded by a clock face glass box and other odd things has been released which is the reason he got the key (clock hand) in the first place</text>, <text>During this book Arthur meets some odd people like some dog-faced men in bowler hats</text>, <text>At the beginning of the book he thought it was all a dream (from his asma attack) but he finds out that everything was very real</text>, <text>Arthur does not know the danger ahead of him untill the night somebody shows up at his window</text>, <text>This book is a wonderful choice</text>, <text>Garth Nix really outdid hiself when he wrote this one</text>, <text>This book reminds me of Ravens Gate in a way so if you read and liked it you will love this! One of the best books I have ever read</text>, <text>This is a dark side of the moon kind of book it is full of suspense and you never what will happen next</text>, <text>You will find yourself captivated by each letter in this book, you will see that you are swept away in the pages but don't want to come out! Mister Monday will do anything to get the key back (you will have to read to see if Arthur makes it through the book alive)!</text>, <text>This book is based mainly for teens having troubles</text>, <text>It shows friendship, love, and dealing with your problems</text>, <text>Not a bad little page-turner</text>, <text>I liked the story line; it has been done before, but not this well</text>, <text>The book sneaks up on you and really [stinks] you in</text>, <text>You find your self almost hurrying to the next page because the suspense builds through to the end of the book</text>, <text>Very good characters with competent development and well thought out roles within the story</text>, <text>I would have liked a bit more detail on the locations</text>, <text>Overall a good book from the period</text>, <text>I found this a good book from a good author</text>, <text>With a believable main chacter, and a cast of funny friends, i enjoyed this book nearly whole heartedly</text>, <text>It also has a little bit of religion questioning</text>, <text>So if your super religous and don't like the idea of a semblance of god wrapped in chains, then this may not be the best book for you</text>, <text>But I didn't mind</text>, <text>Though this series is different from Garth Nix's preivous two series, it's still stays up to my espectations of being mysteroius and strange</text>, <text>Unsurprisingly, there is very little in my mind besides cobwebs right now</text>, <text>Something my friend said after she walked into a chair and flipped over it</text>, <text>Gerard Doyle does a fabulous job of reading the Last Temptation</text>, <text>His voices are great</text>, <text>Detective Carol Jordan and Dr</text>, <text>Tony Hill( pyschologist) are in vestingating the murders of prostitutes who are tortured and killed</text>, <text>Carol and Tony are also investigating the murder and rape of children</text>, <text>Carol and Tony (former lovers) are haunted by the memories of a past criminal investigation</text>, <text>Carol's other police officers are very important to this novel</text>, <text>The story was well plotted and moved quickly</text>, <text>I liked the characters</text>, <text>This book is special, but not incredible</text>, <text>I didn't really enjoy it, but I know some people who did</text>, <text>If you are into good and evil and all that kind of stuff well I guess that you will enjoy it a lot, like my best friend</text>, <text>Although I personally didn't enjoy it much, it is a well written book,  which some people enjoyed a lot</text>, <text>Liz and Sean seem to be a smooth and sophisticated senior high school couple</text>, <text>They introduce their awkward friends Maggie and Dennis to each other</text>, <text>Underneath the veneer of success Liz and Sean have problems with their parents and each other</text>, <text>Do their parents understand or even care about them?  Are they ready for sex?  Meanwhile can Maggie and Dennis learn to communicate enough to stay together?</text>, <text>This book is Paul Zindel's second and was first published way back in 1969</text>, <text>Life has changed since then, such as the free availability of legal abortion, but much of the story is still surprisingly relevant to modern life</text>, <text>Liz and Maggie are the main characters so this could be described as a book for girls, but the lives of Sean and Dennis are also described in important sub-plots</text>, <text>The story is basically a double romance but Zindel has too much of a grip on the ugliness of life to describe the book as 'romantic</text>, <text>'  This is not Mills and Boon stuff</text>, <text>To tell the truth I find this novel one of Zindel's less successful works</text>, <text>To my mind there is nothing in the story to make it really memorable</text>, <text>But then again Zindel is so far above other writers that I would certainly still recommend reading the novel</text>, <text>I should also add that I am largely interested in coming of age stories about boys, so maybe I am biased</text>, <text>I could not put this book down if my life depended on it! I have never in my life read a book this fast</text>, <text>The killers identity will take you by surprise</text>, <text>it did me</text>, <text>I wish that the book was longer, but I'm looking forward to reading Class Trip II(2)</text>, <text>I reccommend this book for anyone, and everyone!!!</text>, <text>I find myself disagreeing whole-heartedly with the negative reviews of Anne Kingston's The Meaning of Wife</text>, <text>I devoured and enjoyed every bit of this book</text>, <text>This was one of the best books on the subjects of women, work, and family that I have read to date</text>, <text>Contrary to one reviewer's beliefs, I have recently read Misconceptions and The Mommy Myth, but still found an amazing amount of original research (not to mention RECENT) in Kingston's text</text>, <text>Not only is The Meaning of Wife jam packed with original research, it also jellies over with meaning! I can't tell you how many times I have pulled this book BACK OFF THE SHELF since placing it there a few weeks ago upon finishing it</text>, <text>In the classroom, I have referenced information from this book more times than I can remember</text>, <text>It's a good thing I annotate!</text>, <text>One thing is for sure, this is not another boring history book</text>, <text>Usually once I put a book down for over a week, I never pick it up again</text>, <text>I put this book down for a few months (due to a hectic end of the semester) and picked it right back up again just this past month</text>, <text>I finished it in record time because it was THAT interesting</text>, <text>But hey, that's just me</text>, <text>Read the book and decide for yourself</text>, <text>I'm wholeheartedly disappointed to see that some reviewers have perceived the author to have a \"chip on her shoulder\" simply because she presents some facts on how society has perceived women who occupy the role of wife</text>, <text>This is a thought-provoking look at the history of how wives are perceived(and yes, let's take our blinders off people, because in one way or another, pop culture affects how we define ourselves, and it sure as heck is affecting our children!)</text>, <text>The research is original and fascinating</text>, <text>I am not opposed to marriage and hope to get married one day; furthermore, I was not at all offended by the tone of the book and did not feel that Kingston was trying to discourage anyone from getting married</text>, <text>Instead, she seems to challenge us to define ourselves beyond restrictive labels</text>, <text>For those who are moaning that the book lacks a thesis, I believe it lies in the proof that she gives over and over throughout the book: not all women are the same and to lump them all in one category (ie</text>, <text>\"the vindictive other woman\", \"the helpless battered woman\", \"the sad, single girl with her cats\", \"the sassy single girl with her Manolo Blahniks\", etc</text>, <text>) has dangerous social consequences</text>, <text>McDermid carefully reminds us of the atrocities committed during the Nazi era in Germany in this, the latest release for the Hill-Jordan series in the U</text>, <text>S</text>, <text>As opposed to many writers in the serial-killer/police procedural genre, Val McDermid consistently paints vivid, if disturbing, psychological portraits of the diseased mind responsible for the crimes committed in her novels</text>, <text>Her psychological material is carefully researched and propels the plot along at a brisk pace</text>, <text>Her writing continues to soar above most of her peers, and the relationship between the two protagonists keeps the reader coming back for book after book</text>, <text>Well done!</text>, <text>Garth Nix built a story like no other</text>, <text>Using the old theme of parallel universes and kingdoms he transformed a normal 13 year old boy into a hero that holds the primary key to the universe</text>, <text>Using the seven deadly sins, the seven days of the week and seven different values, we are taken into a House where everything came from</text>, <text>Arthur Penhaligon and Suzy Blue are two amazing characters, Arthur: a normal boy, asthmatic, not too confident about himself, intelligent and thoughtful</text>, <text>Suzy: a young girl, sensitive, impulsive, strong and brave</text>, <text>Both make the story seem real and really adventurous</text>, <text>There are other great secondary characters as well, Monday's Noon: the bad guy, loyal servant, strong and fierce</text>, <text>Monday's Dusk: A dark character, a rebel, helps Arthur through some complicated stuff</text>, <text>And finally, Mister Monday and The Will</text>, <text>Overall the story is amazing, Garth Nix is really an incredibly imaginative author and everything he writes is always a great story</text>, <text>I'd recommend this book to any fantasy fan or any fan of a really good story</text>, <text>Also read: Grim Tuesday, Drowned Wednesday, Sir Thursday and Lady Friday</text>, <text>I first started this series a year ago while traveling to New Jersey</text>, <text>This book was so good it took me 5 hours to read it</text>, <text>I still had 6 hours before we made it to New Jersey</text>, <text>The whole series is very fasinating and creative</text>, <text>This can be confusing sometimes but it brings you right back</text>, <text>My only disappointment is that I have to wait a year for Superior Saturday</text>, <text>this is one of the best books i have ever read! garth nix is amazing at making Arthur, Suzy, Monday, the Will, Dawn, Noon, and Dusk all come to life</text>, <text>it is the best horror/action/adventure book i haver ever read</text>, <text>Arthur is saved by a key, that chages his fate entirely</text>, <text>he has Asmatha and the minute hand looking key saves him</text>, <text>but the key made a strange house appear</text>, <text>and at school, some dog faced men come in to kill him along with Noon for the key, so Arthur couldn't be master of the Lower House if he could get the hour hand key from Monday inside the strange house</text>, <text>this book is EXTREAMLY good, but very confusing at times</text>, <text>Garth Nix rules!</text>, <text>If you are looking for a thrilling fantasy book, I recommend that you read the series of books The Keys to the Kingdom by Garth Nix</text>, <text>This mysterious novel is about a boy called Arthur Penhaligon who is not supposed to be a hero; he is in fact, supposed to die an early death</text>, <text>But his life is saved by a minute hand shaped key</text>, <text>Arthur is safe</text>, <text>but his world is in danger</text>, <text>Along with the key comes a plague brought by creatures from another realm</text>, <text>A villain, his messenger with blood stained wings, and an army of dog faced creatures will do anything to get the key back, even if it means destroying Arthur and everything that surrounds him</text>, <text>Desperate to save his world, Arthur ventures into a mysterious house that only he can see</text>, <text>In this house, Arthur will have to unravel the key's secrets and discover his true fate</text>, <text>this book dared you to dream of the imposible or mabe not so imposible I am a devil slightly like diabola but much more advanced</text>, <text>This book when i think about it is a biography of my younger years but how could diabola stand to have a sister like angla she is such a discrase to my kind</text>, <text>Instead of telling you the history of India, this book emphasized the history of how the Indian history was discovered by the British, I always love books written by John Keay, though it's more or less written by a British author with a little bit biased view</text>, <text>Arthur a new student at school, has to run a mile in the first day there</text>, <text>Arthur an asthmatic that ment he can't breathe well</text>, <text>He has to do his mile run but at the very end he fell to the ground because of his asthma</text>, <text>Then these two kids Leaf and Ed helps Arthur by running to the office and running to the P</text>, <text>E</text>, <text>teacher</text>, <text>Then when Arthur was about to die Mister Monday and Sneezer ame out of nowhere and gave Arthur a key that looks like the hand of a clock and an atlas</text>, <text>Then they disappeared and Ed and Leaf came running back</text>, <text>Arthur got taken to the hospital and in a few days he got back up and went to school</text>, <text>He went into the library and tuoched the key with the atlas and the atlas turned huge and had a picture of a house</text>, <text>Then that day he started seeing things a whole army of dog-faced Fetchers were standing outside the library window</text>, <text>then there was a guy named Noon came in the library and looked for Arthur then Arthur ran for it and started throwing salt, but some of the dogs got him on his chest,leg, and arm</text>, <text>Then he looked at his watch and saw it was one minute to 1 o' clock</text>, <text>Noon was about to fight Arthur with his Flame Sword</text>, <text>Arthur faked the give and threw the key and when the minute hand struk one o' clock all of the dogs and Noon disappeared</text>, <text>Then they appeared outside laughing, they holded the Atlas up in the air</text>, <text>Then Arthur got a backpack full of salt and melted all the dogs, but no atlas was to be found</text>, <text>Then there was a big fire that Noon started trying to get the key</text>, <text>After Arthur had to go on a bus but made him self have an asthma attack and then was taken to the bus to be taken to the hospital</text>, <text>Arthur then got better and ran out of the hospital heading for the House</text>, <text>Once he went in the house he went to Mondays portal and ended up in this weird land</text>, <text>Arthur had to go threw this big adventure but to get to the point he went to fight Monday with his minute and hour hand key that became a GIGANTIC sword that distroyed Monday and helped Will the protector or lord of the keys that guided Arthur all the way</text>, <text>Then after he went back to his word the illness stoped and everything went back to normal except it was on a TUESDAY</text>, <text>&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;My favorite part was when Arthur and NOon both had swords</text>, <text>Noon with his big flame sword and Arthur with his clock sword</text>, <text>Also it's cool that a tiny key can turn a yiny atlas into a gigantic one</text>, <text>THIS BOOK WAS THE BEST NUMBER ONE 1</text>, <text>THIS A BOOK THAT YOU DONT NEED TO THINK AS MUCH TO KNOW WHATS GOING ON AND IT MAKES A VERY CLEAR PICTURE WITH ALL THE DETAILS THAT WAS GIVEN</text>, <text>I read this book from an adult's perspective</text>, <text>Like many of the reviews have already said, this book was vividly descriptive in nature and very alluring in plot</text>, <text>The take home lesson for any reader would be that we should not just see things as absolute good or absolute evil, but instead see the grey areas - the fine line that separates good and evil</text>, <text>We may not be angelic like Angela or demonic like Diabola</text>, <text>But we find the balance of good and evil in all of us human beings</text>, <text>Depending on which side triumphs over the side on occasions, we behave accordingly - angelically or irrately</text>, <text>I really enjoy Michael Marshall Smith's writing style, and heartily recommend one of his earlier novels, THE STRAW MEN</text>, <text>But THE INTRUDERS is pretty much a middling effort, at least when it comes to the plot</text>, <text>The first half of this novel is certainly well written, but the plotline is disjointed and makes little sense</text>, <text>Smith keeps on shifting perspectives and deliberately keeps the reader off-balance</text>, <text>While some readers may enjoy this type of storytelling, I prefer novels with straightforward narratives</text>, <text>Smith tries to tie everything together toward the end, but his \"explanation\" is so silly and contrived that I felt cheated</text>, <text>In the end, I felt the whole story was pointless</text>, <text>THE INTRUDERS is further weakened by the lack of a truly likable character</text>, <text>While all the characters are intelligent, most of them are dour and anti-social</text>, <text>There are also too many characters to keep track of, and some of them are just stereotypical (the world-weary hit man for example)</text>, <text>Still, Smith is a terrific writer of prose, one of the best out there in genre fiction</text>, <text>There are many passages in thsi novel that I re-read because I was struck by their cleverness and insight</text>, <text>I recommend THE INTRUDERS if you enjoy good writing, but if you want a great story, you should try THE STRAW MEN instead</text>, <text>Like many career-minded young women my age, I have no immediate plans to marry, and I would certainly read thuis book a second time if I were ever going to</text>, <text>We can yap all we want about the importance of committment and love in modern day marriage, but the fact remains that Marriage, as an institution, can be a degrading, wasteful, and downright evil thing</text>, <text>I think a lot of women get married nowadays because it is quite simply the thing to do</text>, <text>A book like this would enable them to make a rational decision in that regard!!</text>, <text>There isn't a way to review The Torment of Others yet because the American edition has not yet been released, (I got one from the UK about three months ago) so I'll just give you my review of both Temptation and Torment here</text>, <text>I hate giving away endings and plots, so I won't do that here, my advice is to read this entire series (Mermaids Singing, Wire in the Blood, Last Temptation) back to back and then buy Torment of Others as soon as you are able</text>, <text>The Torment of others is actually my favorite of the four and I can't wait for the next one</text>, <text>I don't really care for McDermid's other running characters, but I love the dynamics between Tony Hill and Carol Jordan</text>, <text>I don't usually like long-drawn out English romances that may or may not go somewhere, but this relationship is more realistic than most</text>, <text>Oh, and there are some murders to solve in these books, too</text>, <text>:)</text>, <text>First off</text>, <text>I enjoy reading bad reviews for decent books</text>, <text>The reviews of the previous readers either gave MMS full marks or dropped him down to nothing</text>, <text>Its the complaints that get me</text>, <text>They say they want a believable mystery</text>, <text>then go read a Robert B</text>, <text>Parker/Chander novel</text>, <text>Michael Marshall tends to meld Harris and King and sometimes Gibson</text>, <text>It works, sometimes brilliantly</text>, <text>I like that he has stepped out of science fiction</text>, <text>No offense</text>, <text>He great a writer, sometimes it seems like he struggles with direction, but even when this happens he tells it in a way that draws a reader's attention</text>, <text>His novels are not cut and pasted, this one in particular came off as very</text>, <text>please don't stick a spork in my spleen</text>, <text>\"organic</text>, <text>\"</text>, <text>One doesn't know what is coming, or whether the author does either, but its fun</text>, <text>That keeps me special ordering his books</text>, <text>I bought this book for my nine year old</text>, <text>I took a look at it later at home and started reading the prologue</text>, <text>That made me want to read just some of the first chapter, and I ended up reading the entire book</text>, <text>It was a wonderful book, that will capture you from the beginning</text>, <text>Highly impressed and throughly enjoyed it, and I know my son will too</text>, <text>Grown ups and kids will be hooked from the get go</text>, <text>This book is a wonderful story of two twin sisters,</text>, <text>as we all know twin sisters are very different and many people think they are somewhat the same,some do share same characteristics but these two where totaly different,</text>, <text>they were the contrary of each other</text>, <text>For example one was like  an angel,and the other,</text>, <text>well we all know what she was</text>, <text>What I like about  the book is that these two were like the two persons in your shoulder  telling you what is wrong or right</text>, <text>The authors imagination is great and  unpredictable</text>, <text>The twins were like one single person divided into two or  twins were one got all the good and the other got all the bad</text>, <text>I recomend  this book all the way</text>, <text>Mister Monday is an interesting Fantasy novel that draws readers in from the very beginning</text>, <text>The main character, Arthur is flawed and that is what makes him the \"chosen\" one for the Keys to the Kingdom</text>, <text>In this series starter, Arthur learns what power he has as he tries to determine how to live his life with this key that he has obtained and this house and little, scary fantasy creatures that no one else can see but him</text>, <text>Arthur starts to think he is losing it, but a few friends from his P</text>, <text>E</text>, <text>class see the creatures too, so Arthur apprehensively goes on his journey as the reluctant hero who is bound to find a way to save his community and family</text>, <text>This book along with Grim Tuesday will hook readers on this series</text>, <text>I can't wait for the rest of the books in this series</text>, <text>Harry Potter lovers can definitely find a new love in this series</text>, <text>John Kobler is a little-known master craftsman and this is his master work</text>, <text>Don't miss it</text>, <text>Quite possibly the best biography you'll ever read</text>, <text>P</text>, <text>S</text>, <text>PLUS, I learned the word \"chinoiserie\" from this book!</text>, <text>This book has loads of detail and is not that short</text>, <text>It's not a sort of book for a reluctant reader, or someone under the age of 12</text>, <text>It wasn't really my type anyway</text>, <text>I wouldn't lend it to someone in need of a good book</text>, <text>Ernest Gellner stigmatizes Freudianism as a secular religion, where the Unconscious (a new version of the Original Sin) is treated as a Revelation, with a sharp distinction between the sacred (those under analysis) and the profane, between the good (the true believers) and the bad, and where reason must be suspended</text>, <text>Freud's concepts are untestable (the experience - transfer - between analysand and analyst is unique) and nebulous (reality can always be made conform to the system)</text>, <text>His basic technique is free association which should lead to the uncovering of repressed mental contents and correspondent therapeutic consequences for the patient</text>, <text>The only testable component of the theory are its therapeutic claims, but the effectiveness of the therapy is extremely dubious and unproven</text>, <text>For the author, Freudianism is a self-perpetuating, falsification-evading, closed system, which controls its own database</text>, <text>In one word, it is a pseudo-science</text>, <text>Its enormous vested interests (also financial) are cultivated and protected by a guild: UNATO (United Nations Analysis and Therapy Organization)</text>, <text>This brilliantly written, corrosive text contains excellent short evaluations of Nietzsche, Marx, Berkeley, Plato and Stoicism</text>, <text>A must read for all guild-members and outsiders</text>, <text>Mister Monday is the kind of book that pulls you in after the first page and pulls you to the end</text>, <text>It is a very mysterious book, with more beginnings then ends</text>, <text>Arthur is suspended between many betrayals, and has many things like \"Trust the Will\" and then \"Don't trust the Will\" told to him, and is constantly hunted by the lazy mister monday and his Noon (Right hand man), Dawn (Left hand woman) and constantly helped by Mondays Dusk, the final of the trio of the day (You may have guessed Mister Monday can only come to earth on monday, his dawn can only come from 12:01 AM-1:00 AM, Noon can only come from 12:00 PM-1:00 PM, and finaly dusk can come from 11:00 PM-12:00 AM)</text>, <text>With only the lesser part of the first key to aid him, Arthur is always fighting against the odds</text>, <text>Not only does he have to defeat Mister Monday but the other Morrow days as well</text>, <text>A great beginning of a series, The Keys to the Kingdom is definatly going to be a wonderfull tale indeed</text>, <text>I picked this book up in Bangkok as I was browsing through a second hand book store, and didn't expect much until I read that this was a novel by the guy who wrote House of Cards, To Play the King and The Final Cut</text>, <text>As mentioned above, this covers the events leading up to World War 2</text>, <text>It provides a great insight into the behind the scenes goings-on in parliament, the rivalries and treacheries in the run up to Winston Churchill becoming Britains war time Prime Minister</text>, <text>It's a superb read, really gripping from the first page through to the end</text>, <text>Definately recommended for anyone who has an interest in WW2, Churchill or British history</text>, <text>In fact, I would definately recommend this to anyone, it's easy going and difficult to put down</text>, <text>To me, this book requires some imagination and patience</text>, <text>I could not just breeze through the Prologue and other parts of the book without having to go back and reread some parts</text>, <text>But once I got into the beginning and reading about Arthur, the hesitant hero, the book grew on me</text>, <text>I found it was quite easy to visualize the main character's adventures when he was on Earth in the beginning, but when the book shifted to the other world</text>, <text>I kind of got confused again</text>, <text>But I did not give up reading the book</text>, <text>I kept on, trying to visualize where Arthur was</text>, <text>The other world is quite original with its descriptions and the names given to different places, the characters, and so forth</text>, <text>I was kind of expecting Leaf to be with Arthur through the book as a sidekick, but I liked Suzy just as well</text>, <text>I really like the quick adventure on the stairs and where it lead Suzy and Arthur</text>, <text>I was glad to find out where Suzy came from</text>, <text>I didn't even think about that until they reached the one platform</text>, <text>Mr</text>, <text>Monday was a funny, lazy villian (or rather a sleepy villian)</text>, <text>But I will say that Garth Nix is a very clever, talented writer</text>, <text>I liked how he made me think about what I was reading</text>, <text>It wasn't the kind of book, for me at least, where you can just read through and not pay attention</text>, <text>You have to pay attention to the writing because he eventually goes back to those details later on</text>, <text>There are connections, and I like a book like that</text>, <text>So, in my opinion, if you read it, pay attention to the writing, be patient, and don't forget to add your imagination</text>, <text>Thanks</text>, <text>This book surprised me</text>, <text>Given the title and the cover photo, I expected a more hostile discussion of marriage</text>, <text>What the book offers instead is a well thought out, articulate discussion of marriage in the 21st century</text>, <text>I've long been perplexed by the number of wedding related shows on cable TV, and I've been truly astonished by what people are paying for their weddings</text>, <text>I suppose it's a byproduct of our sexually \"liberated\" age that brides wear white even after having children, being divorced, etc</text>, <text>so that the beautiful white dress no longer means \"brand new bride\"</text>, <text>The author explains the \"Wedding Industrial Complex\" that drives the image of the \"perfect\" wedding at the expense of all sensibilities</text>, <text>At the center of this, of course, is The Dress, that iconic image of marital bliss</text>, <text>The book also discusses wifely history, and of great concern to me these days, what women and men are doing about The Name Problem</text>, <text>I never thought it would still be an issue so many years on</text>, <text>but it is, and it's relevant, and we still don't have good solutions</text>, <text>In spite of the cover shot, this book is not anti-marriage</text>, <text>It is, however, anti-stupidity about marriage and weddings in particular</text>, <text>Read it if you are planning to get married, and read it if like me, you've been there, done that, and are doing it again soon</text>, <text>(I am truly mystified by why a second time bride would wear white, however</text>, <text>White speaks of marriage as a brand new thing</text>, <text>I do believe it should be left to first time brides, preferably those without kids, as white dresses after kids are still just silly</text>, <text>Yes, I know that's old school of me, and I really wish I felt differently</text>, <text>it's a matter of etiquette, not morality, however, in my case</text>, <text>)</text>, <text>the end really confused me i thought liz would end up with sean and maggie would end up with dennis</text>, <text>The book relates, with common sense and humor, instructions given early Americans on proper table manners, conversation and correspondence, dress, behavior in the drawing room and in public places, and it includes a special, more intimate section - \"For Womankind\"</text>, <text>Mister Monday is one book you will not put down</text>, <text>This is great mystery</text>, <text>It keeps you thinking all the time</text>, <text>it is about a 13 year-old boy named Arthur who has a mystery to solve and to save the world</text>, <text>He is supposed to die but is saved by a key</text>, <text>He doesn't know why he was given this key, but it is the only thing keeping him alive</text>, <text>The person who gave it to him is named Monday and wants the key back</text>, <text>Monday sends his fetchers to retrieve the key but Arthur doesn't let them</text>, <text>soon enough they go away, but leave behind a mysterious diease</text>, <text>It is spreading rapily through his town</text>, <text>Arthur knows he has to find a cure for it</text>, <text>He thinks he knowswhere he could find a cure-in a mysterious house only he can see</text>, <text>With the help of the key, he travelsinside the house and is swallowed into an adventure he'll never forget</text>, <text>I would recommed this book for ages 11 and up</text>, <text>It is one of the best books I've ever read</text>, <text>This book is awesome!</text>, <text>Arthur Penhaligon, only 13, survives what is supposed to be his death on his first day at a new school when he is handed a key shaped like the minute hand on a clock by the elusive Mister Monday</text>, <text>This key enables him to fight off the dog-faced Fetchers that are searching his school for him, and then get into the mysterious House he alone seems to be able to see in order to find a cure for the Sleepy Plague the Fetchers seem to have started</text>, <text>Once inside the house, he finds obstacles, a friend to help him, and a fragment of the Will which states how everything should be run in the house and the Secondary Realms, in which his house is</text>, <text>The Will gives him instructions on how to get the Greater Key (shaped like the hour hand on a clock) from Mister Monday and become Master of the Lower House</text>, <text>Garth Nix has woven another intricate fantasy tale including wonderfully believable characters, strange creatures, and a tendency for the unexpected</text>, <text>His series including Sabriel, Lirael, and Abhorsen left me wanting more of his work, and I have not been disappointed by this new tale of his</text>, <text>I am going to quickly get the second book and then impatiently await the next five</text>, <text>I first got this book when I was eight and I totally loved it!  I have read it every year since then! It is about a pair of twins who are born one VERY good and one EXTREMELY bad</text>, <text>Angela and Diabola</text>, <text>Diabola causes chaos wherever she goes, whereas Angela is ever so sweet and angelic</text>, <text>When Diabola claims to not care about her father he leaves the family</text>, <text>Mrs</text>, <text>Cuthberson-Jones is left alone to cope with DIabola something she has never done before</text>, <text>As Diabola becomes meaner, she develops powers</text>, <text>Angela is becoming even more good</text>, <text>How will the good and evil balance out? Read this book to find out</text>, <text>As much as I like these kinds of surreal books, I haven't seen too many authors that go this route</text>, <text>Their heart just isn't in it</text>, <text>So I'm very happy to see such a rare, daring feat like Mister Monday in print</text>, <text>The book starts off with a wild prologue that sets up the Keys to the Kingdom series</text>, <text>Words write themselves through the air on some kind of distant star</text>, <text>Very strange</text>, <text>It takes about two chapters or so before the reader adjusts to the insane style</text>, <text>The main character Arthur has just moved to a new school (typical of children's books) and is plagued with asthma</text>, <text>(Currently, main characters in the publishing industry are always made out to be weak underdogs at first</text>, <text>Forget the old-fashioned Conan the Barbarian style</text>, <text>)</text>, <text>Arthur's immediately visited by the sleepy Mister Monday and his butler Sneezer, and is given a key in the shape of a clock hand</text>, <text>Arthur is afterwards harassed and pursued by guys in bowler hats named Fetchers - imaginary fellows that spread a deadly plague, led by a guy with a sword of fire</text>, <text>Arthur doesn't know what to do to stop the plague, so he goes to a weird house only he can see</text>, <text>The book starts getting really fun at this point</text>, <text>We see people with angel wings, dinosaurs, an old guy with drilled out eyes, elevators of light, monsters with backwards faces who have one leg longer than the other, etc</text>, <text>Crazy stuff that'll keep you reading</text>, <text>Arthur finds out the only way he can stop the plague in his world is to defeat Mister Monday, and a ceramic frog guides him along in his journey</text>, <text>Going through the weird house to reach Mister Monday's dayroom isn't easy, but after many trials and some help from a girl named Suzy, Arthur manages to do so</text>, <text>Mister Monday's lazy personality completely changes when his authority is threatened, and after a violent confrontation, Arthur emerges victorious</text>, <text>With Mister Monday defeated, Arthur is able to go back home and cure the Fetcher plague</text>, <text>Then the build up to the second book promptly begins</text>, <text>It's very difficult to write in this \"anything goes\" style</text>, <text>No style is better at freeing up the imagination, but like everything else there is a price to pay</text>, <text>Usually when a work like this is loaded with imagination, continuity suffers as a result</text>, <text>I like to call this the \"Pee-Wee's Playhouse Effect</text>, <text>\"  Wonderful stuff constantly happens, but it's all disjointed, chaotic, and confusing</text>, <text>Personally, I don't mind the sacrifice of order a bit, especially in a book for children</text>, <text>My only comments are \"Do we really need the Ed and Leaf characters?\" and \"Why's the guy in Ancient Greece speaking English?\"  Ed and Leaf may be useful throughout later books in the series, but the Greek guy seems to have been a boo-boo</text>, <text>Unless there's some place in the book I missed, mentioning that someone on the improbable stair is able to understand all languages</text>, <text>Despite my best efforts to read every word, it is possible for me to skip/forget certain things</text>, <text>The book has a sentence saying evolution is a fact</text>, <text>Of course the entire scientific community agrees, but Christian readers should be aware of this</text>, <text>From what I've heard, the author Garth Nix doesn't believe in any religion, and you can see this reflected in the main character Arthur at one point</text>, <text>I bought Mister Monday for a special price of $2</text>, <text>99 and it includes an enlighting author interview at the end</text>, <text>I guess Scholastic is making the first book cheap in an attempt to get people into the whole series</text>, <text>I really liked the book a lot, but six more books seems like too much to read when I already have an extensive reading list</text>, <text>I'm glad I'm not into Harry Potter</text>, <text>It's little things like Komodo Dragon decorations coming to life, candle flames that don't flicker, and coins capable of screaming that make this book great</text>, <text>This is as imaginative as writing can get</text>, <text>I love it</text>, <text>Maggie and Liz get into a lot of trouble these days</text>, <text>being in class mucking around and a lot of boy trouble</text>, <text>I recommend this book to those who have situations that</text>, <text>trouble them with adolecent lives</text>, <text>I received this book as a trade from bookcrossing</text>, <text>com</text>, <text>I had once read the Pigman in high school, unfortunately, this book doesn't measure up</text>, <text>Maggie and Liz are friends</text>, <text>Liz is a little more outgoing and popular, who sets Maggie up on a double date with her and Sean</text>, <text>Maggie goes out with Dennis who looks like an \"undernourished zucchini</text>, <text>and always wearing the same baggy sweater</text>, <text>\"</text>, <text>Liz and Sean are very into each other, but Sean keeps pushing the issue with whether or not they are going to \"do it</text>, <text>\" When they get into a fight once again, Liz goes out with an older guy who practically rapes her</text>, <text>When Sean and Liz meet up again, she gives him what he wants, but</text>, <text>with a price</text>, <text>Even though the book was written in the late 60's, some underlying themes stay the same: pregnancy, abortion, not getting along or being able to communicate with parents, suicide, and premarital sex</text>, <text>It seems as though the author had covered everything</text>, <text>but</text>, <text>for a long while, the book just wasn't very interesting</text>, <text>It's a very quick read, but I didn't get into it until it was almost over</text>, <text>Also, I didn't get the closure I needed at the end between Liz and Maggie</text>, <text>It's a nice cautionary tale for students that are of high school age, but maybe I've read too much good Young Adult literature in the past to be impressed by this one</text>, <text>I've borrowed this book from the school library</text>, <text>Well, what I can say about this book is,it's very interesting</text>, <text>It is about a pair of twins</text>, <text>One is good(called Jill),another is bad(called Jane)</text>, <text>But later their parents made them to be christian and the good one called Angela while the bad one called Diabola</text>, <text>Everyone loves Angela much and hate Diabola</text>, <text>When the twins grow up, they have power to do good things and bad things</text>, <text>Of course, the good one do good and the bad one do bad</text>, <text>Their power were so strong that the bad one can make people sick by using her eyes and the good one can cure them if she want</text>, <text>I think this book is really interesting because no book I've read have got such extreme case</text>, <text>The positive jacket blurb from Stephen King convinced me to read this book, but I wish I'd picked something else</text>, <text>This book is a total mess: the key concept makes no sense, the characters are mostly uninteresting, and the big introductory scene about the murder of the scientist's family has NOTHING to do with the plot</text>, <text>You will never get back the hours you waste on this book</text>, <text>This is my 3rd McDermid novel, I previously read 'Mermaids Singing' and 'Wire in the Blood</text>, <text>' McDermid writes good prose but in this 3rd novel I see dangerous repetitions in character types which, if repeated in the next Tony Hill/Carol Jordan book will make that one my last purchase</text>, <text>Generally McDermid paints female police officers as brighter, more diligent and more intuitive than their male counterparts, as well as more often homosexual</text>, <text>The men, with the exception of leading man Tony Hill, are mostly all egotistical, back-stabbing, power-hungry morons of the lowest order, while Hill is rendered impotent -- a redundant bit of emasculation since all the other males are castrated of their moral fiber</text>, <text>The slow mating dance between Hill and Jordan gets a lot of buildup and little payoff</text>, <text>And in this book, the serial killer and the surrounding hunt for him are as limply portrayed as Dr</text>, <text>Hill</text>, <text>The emotional connection between Hill and the killers in the two previous books is missing here, making the entire killer plot read like an afterthought</text>, <text>And the real villain -- not the serial killer but a drug-pushing / illegal-immigrant smuggler loses character focus as the reader is given reason to sympathize with him as well as with the killer</text>, <text>The climactic scenes involving the capture of one villain and the death of another are without any sense of thrill or danger</text>, <text>I was extremely disappointed with this book</text>, <text>Without any sense of trying to make the experience any more horrifying than it was Primo Levi describes the day to day existence with clarity</text>, <text>THe few moments of decency he experiences in the book are to be cherished as he presents the most compelling reason for and against the continued survival of the human race</text>, <text>Primo Levi is a writer too compelling to put down</text>, <text>For the cour you are with him as he becomes a machination of the Reich, and as he reclaims his humanity in the last chapter</text>, <text>In this first book in the series, Keys to the Kingdom, we find Aurther Penhaligon, a seventh grader who recently moved to a new and strange home</text>, <text>Of, course, it doesn't seem strange to him- at first</text>, <text>Aurther has heavy asthma, which places him in the hospital quite often</text>, <text>One Monday morining, Aurther is in Gym in his new shcool, and has an asthma attck on the run they were on</text>, <text>During this attack, A strange man named Mister Monday comes, and is tricked into giving Aurther a minute hand shaped \"key\"- which is what they called it</text>, <text>As soon as Aurther holds this key, he finds that he can breathe, and he doesn't die the death that he was meant to die</text>, <text>&lt;br&gt;     But with this key comes strange creatures from another dimension who pursue the key, and though he doesn't know why, Aurther knows that he shouldn't give it to them{they work for Mister Monday- who wants the key back}</text>, <text>These creatures, called Fetchers bring a terrible disease called the \"Sleepy Pluage\", which after afew symtoms like having a cold, puts the infected people to sleep- literally- they fall asleep, and can't be woken up! Aurther is particually sensitive to this outbreak beacuse he is adopted{his birth parents died in a flu outbreak when he was a baby}</text>, <text>He couldn't bear to have more loved ones lost to a disease outbreak</text>, <text>&lt;br&gt;    Then, Aurther notices a strange house that only he can see</text>, <text>He has a feeling that the answer to curing the sick people is to go in there</text>, <text>But what he finds when he does is a another world, calle the House, which was created by the Great Architect- the creator of all things</text>, <text>&lt;br&gt;     This aerchitect left long ago, but left a will to be followed through- BUT IT WAS NOT!!! The will was broken in seven fragments, and scattered through time and space</text>, <text>Now the first and least fragment of the Will has escaped, and it is helping Aurther</text>, <text>It says that he is the rightfull heir to the kingdom{the House} but all Aurther wants is a cure to the Sleepy Plauge</text>, <text>The Will tells Aurther that to find this cure, he has to defeat Mister Monday, using the Minute Hand key, and claim Mondays half of the key {the Hour Hand}which will then bind with the Minute Hand to become the first and least Key to the Kingdom</text>, <text>Aurther, Suzy Blue{a friend he makes on the way} and the Will now will go through many treacherous tasks to defeat Monday- the Will so that Aurther can claim the key, therefore the first part of the Will is done, Aurther to find a cure to thing strange plauge, and Suzy to help them all</text>, <text>I thought that this book was amazing, had great detail, and was imaginative in every way</text>, <text>Garth Nix did a great job, and I can't wait to read Grim Tuesday, the next book in the Keys to the Kingdom series!</text>, <text>Gregory McDonald once wrote funny, interesting books</text>, <text>The Flynn series was unique, and the early Fletch books were great</text>, <text>His skills seem to have deteriorated, and his last three or four books have been eminently forgettable</text>, <text>Sad</text>, <text>This is a great first book of the series</text>, <text>I really loved the fast pace, the vivid descriptions, and the characters</text>, <text>Arthur is whisked away into another world, where he must face the ultimate challenge:  to defeat Mr</text>, <text>Monday</text>, <text>With the help of his new interesting friends, Suzy and the Will, he will face his destiny to become the rightful heir(s)</text>, <text>Everyone is sure to luv this book!</text>, <text>P</text>, <text>S</text>, <text>Mr</text>, <text>Monday rox my sox!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</text>, <text>What can I say that has not been said before? McDermid's psychological mysteries are absolutely brilliant</text>, <text>She creates memorable characters and her plots are so brilliantly woven</text>, <text>I could not put this book down</text>, <text>But then, I can't put any of McDermid's books down</text>, <text>She gets better and better, though I have no interest in reading her Kate Brannigan series--they sound so fluffy after reading these *intense* psychological mysteries</text>, <text>Ok, I am telling you right now, I always finish a book if nothing else just to get closure, but I stopped and finally put it down and just couldn't waste my time anymore</text>, <text>I tried several time to do pick it up and continue, but finally just gave up and put it down</text>, <text>How convoluted, Salvador Dali thinking processed can you get? The real time part of this book is good and you become attached to the characters, but the minute you go to his otherworld it is so convuluted, out of touch it just can't come together</text>, <text>I think this writer could be really talented and has a lot to offer he just needs to stay in the real world</text>, <text>I had to stop reading it and I dont' recommend it</text>, <text>If you don't already know it, this is Poirot's last case</text>, <text>I came across this book after I had read MANY other Poirot's cases and I was familiar with the surroundings</text>, <text>Lady Agatha takes us back to Styles Court, where we first met the little Belgian man with the egg shaped head</text>, <text>And so, the circle is closed</text>, <text>This is, in my opinion, the most mature of Christie's stories</text>, <text>Poirot faces the ultimate assassin: an individual capable of the perfect crime</text>, <text>He understands his methods, but also finds it impossible to intervene</text>, <text>And so he takes the matter on to his own hands, although knowing that no crime can go unpunished</text>, <text>Maybe the essence of the book is in the last few lines, hidden by a mark on a man's forehead</text>, <text>Don't miss it</text>, <text>This book is not the best book for storytime or a bedtime story</text>, <text>It is very short and has little action</text>, <text>However, it is great for teaching beginning math vocabulary dealing with size</text>, <text>I was curious to see whether \"Mister Monday\" (first novel in a fantasy series that has since worked its way up to Thursday) was published before or after James Stoddard's \"High House\" as the two books have similar settings</text>, <text>Stoddard came first, but Garth Nix has put his unique stamp on the 'Universe manifested as a queer old House' theme</text>, <text>That said, this \"Keys to the Kingdom\" series is more disjointed and less appealing than Garth Nix's Abhorsen trilogy</text>, <text>\"Mister Monday\" reminds me more of \"The Ragwitch\" in that a young boy with absolutely no training learns that he is the Rightful Heir to some improbable kingdom (the Universe) and is also the only person on Earth who can stop/cure the newest, deadliest plague</text>, <text>Naturally Arthur wants to concentrate on curing the plague, since his own family is involved</text>, <text>Then he is saved from a lethal asthma attack by a man in a bath chair wielding the minute hand off of a gigantic clock</text>, <text>The man in the bath chair is Mr</text>, <text>Monday and he is being pushed about by his butler, Sneezer</text>, <text>These two men spend the rest of the book chasing Arthur through a sort of Victorian workers' hell, trying to get him to return the Key (the minute hand) to Mr</text>, <text>Monday</text>, <text>The book has lots of interesting magic, blue-and-yellow-striped dinosaurs, an angry old man who is chained to a gigantic clock, and a pair of truly macabre creatures who gouge out the old man's eyes every day at 12 o'clock</text>, <text>(His eyes grow back</text>, <text>Does this man remind you of Prometheus, kiddies?)</text>, <text>Arthur must get through some horrifying trials to save his Earth from the plague, and to prove that he is the Rightful Heir</text>, <text>He shows that he has the Right Stuff--after all, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday have already been written--but this first book suffers from a multiplicity of themes</text>, <text>The author seems to have tried out several different settings (Victorian policemen and a sort of Bob Cratchit universe, along with dinosaurs, good and bad angels, and a really stinky and terrifying Roman bathhouse), then didn't want to discard anything</text>, <text>So, here it all is in \"Mister Monday</text>, <text>\"</text>, <text>I'm still debating as to whether I want to advance on to \"Grim Tuesday</text>, <text>\" Arthur has already saved my world from the Sleepy Plague and I'm not particularly taken with the rest of Nix's mixed-up Universe</text>, <text>Angela and Diabola is a silly, funny and a great book</text>, <text>I loved the chapter: Diabola develops new skills</text>, <text>I loved it when Diabola went asking for money and said, \" Give me some money and I won't hurt you!\" to the man and sending away those 2 people with the invisibe gun that shot 1 of them away</text>, <text>I also loved the chapter: Gym and other lessons</text>, <text>I liked it when Dybo pushed  miss Mursles off the climbing frame without any clothes on! Angela and Diabola is a great book for all ages because it is not violent but it is extra funny</text>, <text>I think that Angela and Diabola is the best book I read this year!!!!!!!!!!</text>, <text>Garth Nix has done it again, he has again come up with a new and creative plot in a magical world even more real than that of his Old Kingdom</text>, <text>The book follows the adventures of a young, asthmatic boy, who inherits a strange clockhand</text>, <text>It is not long after before things start going amuk, and strange forces threaten his world</text>, <text>The boy, Arthur Penhaligon, drawn into complete despair, ventures into a house only he can see, and into a world he where he should not be</text>, <text>This book is sort of a cross between Harry Potter and the Matrix, but with clear invention and an all together fun story</text>, <text>Hold on tight, and don't be left behind!</text>, <text>Part of the \"Paladin Movements and Ideas\" series, this book is an exploration of the latter half of the 19th century, explaining where Sigmund Freud came from and why he happened when he did</text>, <text>The psychoanalytic movement went on to become one of the major movements in the 20th century</text>, <text>I thought that ANGELA AND DIABOLA by Lynn Reid Banks was a good and funny book, because at some parts it makes me laugh and at others it's very exciting</text>, <text>The kind of reader that might enjoy this book is someone that likes adventure, excitement and funny books like me</text>, <text>You should read this book because it's about twins that don't seem anything alike</text>, <text>You shouldn't read this book if you don't like it</text>, <text>How you know you don't like it is if you don't like exciting, funny and adventurous books</text>, <text>Angela is one of the main characters and on of the twins, and is a sweet, kind and, can you believe when she was being born she wasn't crying at all, that can't be</text>, <text>She wasn't mean and loud</text>, <text>Diabola in the other hand was born crying, kicking fighting</text>, <text>She had teeth to bite the nurse's thumb and forefinger</text>, <text>Their parents they think that Angela is an angel and can get whatever she wants</text>, <text>Then comes Diabola</text>, <text>Their parents paid no attention to her at all</text>, <text>Their mother always has to deal with her</text>, <text>Not many times the dad</text>, <text>She doesn't like it at all</text>, <text>It's like the parents have chores going on and off taking care of Diabola</text>, <text>The author's settings are in a lot of places, such as the hospital where the twins were born, their house where the twins live and plenty of others</text>, <text>Also in the story Angela and Diabola oops</text>, <text>you'll have to find out when you read this great book</text>, <text>I would recommend ages 8 and over because that's the ages it would make sense to, but if you are younger you can ask your parents to read it to you</text>, <text>Other books by this author is THE INDIAN IN THE CUPBOARD, THE FAIRY REBAL, I HOUDINI, MAURA'S ANGEL and many other good books</text>, <text>I stumbled upon this book in a Scholastic (or some such) catalog from my mother who is a middle school teacher</text>, <text>She's been buying me whatever kids' books I've wanted from the catalogs and it's been rather hit and miss</text>, <text>In any case, I wasn't expecting much but I was overwhelmed by the complexity yet clearness of Garth Nix's writing</text>, <text>I noticed there were no reviews on the cover and was surprised, continually, that I'd not heard of him before</text>, <text>This is a new favorite!  By the way, I'm 30</text>, <text>Another book by Garth Nix that changes the name of reading entirely! I've read the entire Seventh Tower series which was one big thriller, but Mister Monday is so compelling you can't put it down</text>, <text>I loved this book probably because I love every book I read but mostly because Garth Nix is an awesome author</text>, <text>Mister Monday is about a young boy named Arthur Penhaligon who must save his world from a plague but must go through the biggest dangers that he must overcome in another realm</text>, <text>The question is can he do it</text>, <text>I suggest this book for about every bookworm, people who like Garth Nix's books, and Fantasy lover out there</text>, <text>You won't be disapointed, and I mean it!</text>, <text>It would be easy to bluntly horrify the reader in a book about life in a death camp, but Levi is not content to appeal to the emotions</text>, <text>He has an intellectual fascination with details, and the psychology of genocide</text>, <text>By a dispassionate and careful treatment of the very difficult material, he manages to write a compelling book about a terrible subject</text>, <text>And the emotional effect does not suffer from this approach--because Levi does not manipulate them, the reader's feelings are deeper and more lasting</text>, <text>In one chapter, Levi describes how many of the prisoners, after fourteen hours of manual labor, would assemble in one corner of the camp in a market</text>, <text>They would trade rations and stolen goods</text>, <text>Levi describes how the market followed classical economic laws</text>, <text>Whenever I remember this I am freshly amazed at the resilience of life, and the ability of people to live and think and work in the most adverse conditions</text>, <text>It is remarkable that I finished a book about the Holocaust with a better opinion of mankind than I started with; I think the fact that the book affected me this way is the best recommendation</text>, <text>McDermid is the author of several series including one with serial killer profiler, Tony Hill and DCI Carol Jordan first introduced in the superb THE MERMAIDS SINGING</text>, <text>This current book is the third one in the series</text>, <text>Two storyline threads interweave themselves into this compelling plot</text>, <text>Carol is offered the bone of a possible promotion if she would agree to an undercover assignment</text>, <text>The assignment concerns getting to know and possibly date a criminal in Germany who imports illegal immigrants from Asia, as well as, drugs</text>, <text>She is to gain his confidence and set him up for arrest</text>, <text>Of course, if her cover is blown, her life will be in imminent danger</text>, <text>At the same time, a serial killer is murdering psychology professors in Germany</text>, <text>The killings are done in a particularly gruesome manner</text>, <text>Tony Hill is on the trail</text>, <text>Val McDermid is a superb storyteller</text>, <text>She succeeds in creating full rich characters that illicit a great deal of empathy with the reader</text>, <text>The parallel plots work quite well together and greatly heighten suspense to the degree that the book simply cannot be put down</text>, <text>This is another strong recommendation for one of our best writers working today</text>, <text>Val McDermid is a top-class crime writer - she rarely fails to deliver and I am pleased to say, this book is great</text>, <text>Dr Tony Hill and DCI Jordan are back - hurrah!  Tony Hill is the profiler who has retired to a backwater university to lick his wounds after the traumatising experiences he has suffered in the past</text>, <text>He is drawn back to the fray when his old love interest, DCI Jordan, becomes involved in a dangerous undercover mission in Eastern Europe</text>, <text>Running parallel to this is a creepy serial killer who Tony Hill tries to find and unmask</text>, <text>It is a very entertaining novel and all fans of McDermid will relish it</text>, <text>Despite its cover 'Turbulent Priests' has little to do with bedraggled young women who smoke</text>, <text>It's actually a very cleverly plotted story about a young girl on a island off Ireland who is claimed to be the messiah</text>, <text>A reporter is sent out to chronicle events and, to no surprise, all is not what they appear to be</text>, <text>'Turbulent Priests' is fresh and funny</text>, <text>It lamblasts both the (Catholic) church and Irish society in equal measure without taking it all too seriously</text>, <text>Only the most sensitive will be offended (</text>, <text>although much of the language is crude)</text>, <text>I should also add that the book is rather Irish-centric</text>, <text>Folks from outside Ireland/Britain might not understand much of the verbage or the sarcastic humour</text>, <text>Bottom line: perhaps Colin Bateman's best book</text>, <text>No small praise</text>, <text>I loved this book!  I read the whole thing in less than a week (which is really good time because of my hectic college schedual)</text>, <text>Anyone who has read Nix before, or anyone who hasn't, read this!  Be prepared for a journey of a lifetime crammed into one day</text>, <text>I can't wait for the next book, Grim Tuesday, which will come out December 2003</text>, <text>Believe me when I say I'll be standing in line!</text>, <text>It got me hooked on the first pages, but toward the end it seemed to leave most of it's speciality behind</text>, <text>Don't get me wrong, the book had storyline like no other, it's characters ( or bad guys ) were discribed in a way you just couldn't miss em and</text>, <text>Somehow I was just left wanting to hear more about Leaf and Ed ( two classmates, who could have been good friends to Arthur )</text>, <text>Why couldn't they have helped Arthur more? Maybe that happens in next, coming books</text>, <text>Kingston's book begins with a description of Prince Charles' and Princess Di's wedding and sort of stays there</text>, <text>She spends a great deal of time focusing on the upper classes, whether royalty, celebrities, politicians or CEOs</text>, <text>Ignored, or perhaps forgotten, are those whose weddings cost less than $50,000, who do not have a choice about working or staying home, who get married at City Hall, and who cannot squeeze every dime out of the ex--because he doesn't have that much more himself</text>, <text>Ignored also are issues such as the effect of parenthood on a marriage, same-sex marriages (even lesbians do laundry), and the role that religion has played in marriage</text>, <text>Kingston's book not only focuses on the upper echelons, but the most extreme marraiges</text>, <text>Her chapter on divorce, for example, portrays women who just about break the law getting back at their ex-husbands</text>, <text>If you are an average woman who took two weeks off her job for her honeymoon, pick something else</text>, <text>The writing is good, but</text>, <text>way too many characters - I couldn't keep them straight and it was WAY too long, by 50 - 75 pages</text>, <text>Editing would have made it not great but better</text>, <text>My relationship with Australian author Garth Nix is an odd one</text>, <text>My first introduction to Nix was in middle school when I attempted to read his famous Sabriel novel after being relentlessly urged to do so by friends</text>, <text>I couldn't get further than one hundred pages</text>, <text>It was so excruciatingly boring that I had to stop -and I rarely give up on books that after I've begun them</text>, <text>Considering my taste in literature, Nix's books should fit perfectly with my preferences, but something about them just falls short</text>, <text>I thought I'd try again with the first book in Nix's The Keys to the Kingdom series, Mister Monday</text>, <text>The book is very similar to the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, and is even being touted as the next Harry Potter</text>, <text>I can definitely see the connects between Mister Monday and these other series, but there is little else there besides the fact that Mister Monday is a somewhat dark, young adult fantasy novel</text>, <text>Mister Monday follows the story of Arthur Penhaligon who, during an asthma attack, is entrusted with a magical key by the mysterious Mister Monday</text>, <text>Not long after, Arthur's hometown is ravaged by an unexplainable plague</text>, <text>In order to fight the plague, Arthur decides to enter the House (which only he can see) to find a cure</text>, <text>He ends up meeting an odd collection of characters that have some connection to time, setting the House back on its course, and of course, finding a cure for the plague</text>, <text>The book is about as confusing and boring as it sounds</text>, <text>It took me a considerable amount of time to get into it, only to find that the plot makes little to no sense</text>, <text>This confusion is only helped by the fact that Nix tends to rely on extremely vague descriptions of characters and environments that leave the reader wondering where the characters are and what they look like</text>, <text>The characters themselves are paper thin</text>, <text>While Nix creates some unique characters and a fairly interesting hierarchy within the House, it falls flat on its face because the characters are underutilized and not given enough time and attention to mature</text>, <text>I personally disliked the lack of a group of constant supporting characters in the novel</text>, <text>While there were a few, they appeared so little that they didn't have time to make an impact on the reader</text>, <text>That's the biggest difference between The Keys to the Kingdom and Percy Jackson and Harry Potter</text>, <text>The two latter (and more successful) series have wonderful collections of supporting characters, while Kingdom spends so much time trying to explain the plot and the world that their is little time for anything else</text>, <text>I think that there are some wonderful ideas here, but I Nix simply didn't take the time to adequately develop them for the novel</text>, <text>A very great suspense novel</text>, <text>It keeps you on the edge of your seat</text>, <text>The killer's identity will susprise you</text>, <text>I hope she keeps up the good work</text>, <text>I wished it was longer</text>, <text>Arthur Penhaligon (and that just has to be a reference to the Arthurian legend) is just an average kid with bad asthma, until he has an attack that nearly kills him and suddenly finds himself a big player in a world that exists outside reality as he knows it</text>, <text>Arthur's Earth is one set in the future to begin with, which is a bit hard to follow through his reflections on previous events, but it gets even more confusing when he receives on of the Keys and finds the House that is a gateway to another world/time/reality</text>, <text>Time moves differently there and the laws of nature/physics mean nothing</text>, <text>In fact, Nothing pays a large role in the story, the substance out of which many things, good and bad can be created</text>, <text>The Architect (the creator of everything) left a long time ago, but she left instructions as to how things were to be run, a sentient Will</text>, <text>But the trustees defied it and set out to do things their own way</text>, <text>So now it's up to Arthur to set things to right</text>, <text>The Will is going to find a way, and that way is Arthur</text>, <text>The descriptions of Arthur's travels through the House are both interesting and highly confusing at times</text>, <text>I had to reread a few parts more than once to figure out what was going on</text>, <text>You do, eventually, get used to it, but it takes a long while and I felt a bit lost for half of the book</text>, <text>The Stairway was one of the better touches, I thought, those glimpses into the past</text>, <text>Suzy is an excellent character, a good partner/guide for Arthur and the best friend he could have in this world</text>, <text>I, like other reviewers, though, wish that a lot more had been done with Leaf and her brother Ed</text>, <text>The way they were introduced led me to believe that they'd play a much bigger role, as would Arthur's world, neither of which happened</text>, <text>The character development is very slim, too</text>, <text>Much more attention is paid to plot development, which, while nice, is only one half a needed whole</text>, <text>I'm hoping that the second book will take the time to flesh the characters out a bit</text>, <text>I could not put Michael Marshall's latest down</text>, <text>He's created a multi-layered thriller involving a likeable protagonist plus a host of remarkable satellite characters who make you cringe &amp; groan with curiosity &amp; anticipation</text>, <text>Set in the Pacific Northwest, the prologue of THE INTRUDERS starts with an apparently random home invasion, murder &amp; fire</text>, <text>Then we meet Jack Whalen, ex-LA beat cop &amp; a one-book author who's struggling to write another</text>, <text>Instead, he's sitting staring out at the forested panorama &amp; remembering, for some odd reason, a high school classmate &amp; how she didn't quite fit in &amp; who, after trying to get the attention of the handsomest senior jock, committed suicide</text>, <text>That morning, Jack's wife had driven to Seattle for a meeting at her ad agency</text>, <text>That's why, a couple of years ago, they'd moved up to this idyllic little mountain burg on the eastside of the Cascades from Southern California, where they'd met &amp; married ten years before</text>, <text>Then that very same jock, now 20 years older, calls Jack, wanting to see him</text>, <text>Gary Fisher brings a strange tale and Jack, with his beat cop instincts slowly coming alert, senses his visitor isn't telling him everything &amp; some of what he's said doesn't ring true</text>, <text>But Jack has no time for Gary as he's just discovered his wife's cell phone has been found in a Seattle taxi</text>, <text>On Cannon Beach in Oregon, a nine year old girl is struggling with nightmares, her parents' uneasy marriage, &amp; something far more frightening: loss of memory &amp; the arrival of a stranger as she's out on the beach wondering how she got there</text>, <text>When the idea that she's got to go somewhere sets her traveling, the people who help her along the way come to rue it as this nice, little girl with headaches has a killer's instincts</text>, <text>THE INTRUDERS is a tale well-spun with lashings of deceit &amp; determination, action &amp; clues, body &amp; mind invasions &amp; chases, &amp; other scary stuff</text>, <text>It's a thriller that has you connecting dots like mad, except, are you connecting the right ones? Unto the final page, you won't know!</text>, <text>The cover of this book is striking, and helped convince me to buy it</text>, <text>It asks what it means to be a wife today, when wives are both made fun of in pop culture and also sometimes held up as the ideal</text>, <text>As a newlywed myself, I wanted an answer to that question</text>, <text>Kingston does a great job of weaving together pop culture and history, and she's a fun writer</text>, <text>She points out interesting trends, such as the fact that many high-powered women, such as Oprah, choose not to marry today</text>, <text>Sometimes I found myself rereading sentences because they were a bit esoteric, but overall the book is extremely accessible and thought-provoking</text>, <text>Includes affirmations, visualizations, and practical guidance to enhance your inner potential</text>, <text>This is a serial killer story, but it is so much more</text>, <text>It's an insight into the law enforcement agencies across Europe and an undercover police operation all rolled into one</text>, <text>We see the return of criminal psychologist Tony Hill and Carol Jordan a police officer who has just applied for a job with Europol, working behind a desk processing information</text>, <text>But her superiors see her as something more and offer her a job working undercover</text>, <text>Through this undercover work, she and Tony Hill renew their acquaintance and begin chasing down a German criminal named Tadeusz Radecki</text>, <text>He has recently branched out from his drug distribution into people smuggling</text>, <text>Also chasing down Radecki is Petra Becker, a criminal intelligence officer in Berlin who has been after him for years and is hot on his trail after the murder of a drug dealer</text>, <text>She corresponds to a friend in Holland over the Internet and occasionally helps out when it comes to solving crimes</text>, <text>In this case, there is a serial killer on the loose across Europe who seems to be targeting psychologists by replicating atrocities performed during the reign of the Nazi's in Germany</text>, <text>Although spread across Europe and seemingly tenuously linked, the whole story is nicely drawn together</text>, <text>It's a book that would best be classed as a shocker with some descriptive, grisly scenes</text>, <text>We are also treated to the killer's thoughts and the reasons behind his motives, suggesting that there are still more victims of the medical experiments performed during World War 2 than those who died</text>, <text>Val McDermid has once again produced an exciting and entertaining thriller</text>, <text>Fans of the psychological suspense novels will find this one right up their alley</text>, <text>Good Bead paterns alot of pictures of beadwork from 1800's (5 stars) for the detailed information in this book!</text>, <text>this is a really great fantasy book</text>, <text>its very exciting and garth ends it so it makes you read more</text>, <text>this book is about a twelve year old boy named Aurther Penheligon who lost his parents in the outbreak of the flu</text>, <text>it starts out when hes at school and is about to do a croos country run, but he has asthma</text>, <text>during the run he comes to have this thing known as the lesser key, it looks sorta like the minute hand of a clock</text>, <text>but when these dog-faced creatures come to reclaim it they also bring this plague to the world and aurther is the only one who can get the cure</text>, <text>I really enjoyed Sabriel</text>, <text>To a lesser degree, I was also fond of the other books in the The Abhorsen Trilogy</text>, <text>When I was in the mood for some YA fantasy the other week, I immediately turned to Mr</text>, <text>Monday</text>, <text>And it was a pretty good read</text>, <text>Arthur Penhaligon is a classic YA hero-- asthmatic, smart, and non-conformist</text>, <text>The world that he lives in is similar to ours, but different enough to be intriguing</text>, <text>The keys and Mr</text>, <text>Monday are intriguing concepts</text>, <text>The alternative world is a little bit complicated, but I like complicated</text>, <text>Bureaucracy plus the pied piper plus disorganized destiny plus raggedy-wing angels-- lots of stuff to sink your teeth into</text>, <text>My biggest beef has nothing to do with the story</text>, <text>My brand new HarperCollins edition is missing pages 351 to 401</text>, <text>Instead, they bound pages 257-304 where the other pages should have been</text>, <text>That means that I missed the climactic confrontation with Mr</text>, <text>Monday</text>, <text>Very irritating</text>, <text>I have no idea if it was only my book with this problem</text>, <text>Potential buyers should check to make sure that they have all the pages before it is too late to return the book</text>, <text>I'll definitely read Grim Tuesday, in any case</text>, <text>I don't know what the one reviewer of this book is talking about</text>, <text>This book is terrific and I loved it!  Could it be this writer is selling more books than her?  It''s a thought</text>, <text>And in my opinion what other reason would another writer slam another one?  Too much of that nonsense goes on on this site</text>, <text>I think it is an unfair for anyone to do to another writer!  Shame on you guys!</text>, <text>Mister Monday is a fantasy novel to the extreme, with many of the cliches that go along with the distinction</text>, <text>It often gets muddled with overwhelming imagery, perhaps to make up for a lack of plot from time to time</text>, <text>Although it is the literary equivalent of a cluttered desk, Mister Monday's images are rich, and will leave you wanting more</text>, <text>The characters do their job, i</text>, <text>e</text>, <text>you like the heroes and hate the villains, but I wish there were more to them</text>, <text>I was interested enough in the strange and original concept to read on to the next book, so I would venture to say that Mister Monday is definitely worth reading at least once</text>, <text>Garth Nix is usually the first author that I recommend when kids and teens ask me what to read once they've finished all the available Harry Potter books</text>, <text>Nix's prose is by no means a thing of wonder on its own, but his characters, his humor and his whimscal worldbuilding make up for this fact</text>, <text>Highly recommended, especially for the younger set, and any adults who enjoy a little Through The Looking Glass style whimsey</text>, <text>The Endless Game is the first of a two-book series (the second is:  A Spy at Twilight) in the vein of the Le Carre \"Karla\" quartet</text>, <text>Mr</text>, <text>Forbes also played his part in that \"game\" and writes with  considerable authority</text>, <text>The book is well-crafted and grips you as you work  through the developing enigma and misleading clues with the protagonist</text>, <text>The characters are complex and believable, the plot consistent and the  outcome unguessable until the last pages</text>, <text>Altogether, a most satisfying  read for lovers of spy fiction</text>, <text>I thought this book was good cuz it made me think about life</text>, <text>I thought that I was pregnant once so I understood what Liz was going through</text>, <text>Well, at least some of the stuff she went through</text>, <text>It also shows at the end how  even though a couple breaks up they can still be friends</text>, <text>As a parent, I found the book interesting and thought-provoking, but I did not allow my 7 year old to finish it! Don't assume that advanced reading skills make the 7-10 year old set ready for this one, even though Ms</text>, <text>Reid-Banks other books are appropriate</text>, <text>It might be an entertaining point  of discussion with a child 12 or older, but it's too dark for younger ones,  unless you're ready to talk about true evil, adult motivations,  supernatural forces, and fratricide!</text>, <text>I read this book awhile ago when we had spring brack</text>, <text>At the age of 11 this book was a easy book to read</text>, <text>I read this book for mabey 1 and a half days</text>, <text>I love reading and soar though books I like, but when I sit down and read I go though books like mad</text>, <text>&lt;br&gt;  I suggest this book to people who love mysterys and adventure</text>, <text>Despite some minor flaws such as once-established character names changing possibly due to fautly editing and printing, this is in my opinion a great book for several reasons I can't really get into right now other than the  giant Dragonflys of the Planet Pandora is such a cool and crazy aspect of  the book and the story of the mystery of the hind leg is completely wild  and that the Strugatsky's are funny as hell</text>, <text>However,I will say that Noon  22nd Century has many compelling characters</text>, <text>And these charaters drift in  and out of this long dizzy story of what the future will be like in the  22nd Century while changing in spirit, age, and mindset</text>, <text>In conclusion,  If you like your science fiction deep, funny and scary at the same time  while being  horizonal, moody, inventive, and original, then you'll have to  settle for something eles because this book is out of print and I just  spilt coffee and squoze the guts of a tuna fish sandwich all over mine</text>, <text>Sorry</text>, <text>This book explores the manner in which European - well British anyway - people became familiar with India from the 1700s on</text>, <text>It is mostly about the discoverers, but also reveals a lot about what they discovered</text>, <text>And the mysteries that remain</text>, <text>The ancient Harappan civilisation - so developed and yet so static - the Hindu culture and the Buddha who grew within it (but where have the Indian Buddhist gone today - how were they driven away or why did the philosophy become unfashionable), the Jains - a sect of the Buddhists? And then there are the aboriginal peoples of India, the Moslem invasions, and, of course, the British</text>, <text>I have had the good fortune to visit India on several trips - visiting the Taj Mahal, the caves at Elephanta, and Mahabalipuram</text>, <text>But the most spectacular site for me is Khajuraho</text>, <text>All these places are mentioned by Mr Keay (and, of course, many I have not visited) and I found it interesting to read about how each has a context in Indian history and helps us to understand better this continent of enormous population, of refined culture, and of such diverse mixtures of race</text>, <text>But the most amazing thing to me is the realisation that so many of these sites were abandoned ruins that had to be found, explored, restored, conserved</text>, <text>What rich pickings there were for those British colonials who took the continent to heart, and were not repulsed by its alienness</text>, <text>Khajuraho is a case in point, where the erotic nature of much of the adorned temples was a real shock to early explorers</text>, <text>And yet Mr Keay has some great words for it:\"No pin-up ever approached the provocative postures, the smouldering looks and the langourous gestures of the Khajuraho nymphs</text>, <text>Serene rather than saucy, intent rather than ecstatic, they go gracefully about their feminine business, adjusting the hair, applying eye shadow, removing a splinter, approaching their lovers; then the kiss, the caress, the passionate love-making of first aquaintance, and the erotic experiments of a mature affection</text>, <text>Here there is love and beauty, passion and joy, instruction even and inspiration; but anything less sordid it is hard to imagine</text>, <text>One can only feel sorry for those generations of Europeans whose own sexual inhibitions prevented them from seeing it that way</text>, <text>\"Mr Keay explores literature (such as the Ramayana), the leftovers of earlier civilisation (such as coins), architecture (Buddhist, Hindu and Moslem), and paintings</text>, <text>There are a couple of add-on chapters that seem a bit out of place, concerning flora and fauna</text>, <text>But I was a little disappointed that there was nothing of mathematics, astronomy, music</text>, <text>But having said that, this is a good read and a great adventure story that features some extraordinary people</text>, <text>Michael Marshall has a knack that few authors possess</text>, <text>In novel after novel, from Only Forward to Blood of Angels and now to The Intruders, he is able to deftly create sharply incisive and deeply observed characters inside the first page and sustain that sense of compassion and understanding throughout the work, no matter the form within which he is working, no matter the subject</text>, <text>Astonishingly, he consistently crafts genre novels that read like literature, with firm, muscular, and often unexpectedly brilliant prose that forcefully carries intricately layered and compelling stories</text>, <text>With genuine humor, natural dialog and sensible emotional reactions to the insensible and the insane, he shames those embarrassingly mediocre bestselling authors who insist on safely repeating themselves when the initial work itself was lacking, hewing close to publisher demands at the literal expense of the public; artlessly churning out inferior work and daring to call it professional; whose personal voice is indistinguishable from narrative to character and back; authors whose intrusions inform us about less than the work in progress and more about their miserably uninteresting selves</text>, <text>One Marshall is worth several dozen Greg Ileses, a bushel of Patricia Cornwalls, a thousand Gregggg Hurwitzes, a million Dean Koontzes and a number that defies notation of the mind blastingly insipid Kyle Mills</text>, <text>The Intruders is nuanced and dark</text>, <text>Deeply felt and bleak</text>, <text>It is extraordinarily well-wrought</text>, <text>At turns melancholy, frantic and angry</text>, <text>And it is haunting</text>, <text>The idea at its core is ancient and well trod ground; but here, miraculously, Michael Marshall has brought forth new life upon it</text>, <text>However dark, his work shines</text>, <text>Of all her family, only Grandmother understands, or even has time for, Kay's story of catching a magical golden leaf, the kind that makes sand pies--and dreams--real, because she had caught one too when she was young</text>, <text>I'm inclined to agree with Ramseelbird's review, and unlike indiegirl29, I don't recall Liz going out with another guy who nearly rapes her</text>, <text>What I do remember is teens in the 70s claiming to love this book, while I (maybe I wasn't savvy enough) just didn't get it</text>, <text>I sort of maybe guessed that her \"friends\" were accompanying Liz to have an abortion (didn't occur to me whether it was legal or not; I may not have even been aware of the issue of legality)</text>, <text>What struck me more was the unlikelihood of a pretty, cool girl being best friends with an uncool, homely girl</text>, <text>Never saw this in real life</text>, <text>Actually the most vivid memory I have of the story is when Liz calls home to say she'll be late, her stepfather calls her a tramp, and that's when she succumbs to Sean's pressure to have sex</text>, <text>This scenario is what is actually timeless in the story, as opposed to the rest of it</text>, <text>The plot and atmosphere are indeed grim, which is indeed what bothered me</text>, <text>It's darker than any other teen / Young Adult novel I can think of</text>, <text>I certainly couldn't relate to any of the characters</text>, <text>I wasn't cool, didn't have a best friend who was cool, didn't have a boyfriend (pressuring or otherwise), and didn't have a stepparent</text>, <text>I suppose that's not Zindel's fault, but I do expect a fiction author to be able to cause the reader to feel what the characters are feeling, or sympathize with their situations</text>, <text>I suppose that's why I wouldn't recommend this book</text>, <text>Garth Nix's \"Mister Monday\" begins a brand new fantasy series in the \"Keys to the Kingdom\" series</text>, <text>This Australian author is fast-becoming one of the biggest names in fantasy with his reinvention of the genre and his intricate, fascinating plots</text>, <text>Unlike other such authors, who place their heroes in a medieval realm of magical swords, horse-back riding and dragons, Nix follows the example of writers such as Philip Pullman, Susanna Clarke and (to a lesser degree) J</text>, <text>K</text>, <text>Rowling by creating a more contemporary fantasy-world with the flavours and style of the 18th and 19th centuries</text>, <text>Where his \"Seventh Tower\" book was written for younger readers, and \"Abhorsen\" trilogy for teenagers (though many adults got in on the act), \"The Keys to the Kingdom\" are situated smack dab in the centre of these two age groups - though again, I hope this doesn't prevent people of any age group from reading them</text>, <text>The Epicentre of the Universe is a realm known as \"The House\" - a labyrinth of rooms and halls and fantastical landscapes, that are ruled over by the treacherous Trustees, or as they are more commonly known, the Morrow Days</text>, <text>Their task was to take over the supervision of our world (or `The Secondary Realms') from the creator - the Architect, who left Her instructions written in a Will, to be carried out accordingly</text>, <text>But the Days tore the Will into seven pieces and scattered the scraps across the known worlds to be guarded forever more, and only now - thousands of years later - has one fragment of the Will managed to escape</text>, <text>Meanwhile, in the ordinary world, Arthur Penhaligon is coping with the pressures of the first day at a new school</text>, <text>Forced to go on a cross-country run  - even though he has severe asthma - Arthur soon finds himself lagging behind, and eventually collapses on the lawn</text>, <text>Whilst his classmates run for help, the strangest thing happens: a young man and his butler appear from nowhere, and bequeath to Arthur something that they call a \"Key\" (though to Arthur it looks more like a large minute hand from a clock), and a strange book called `The Compleat Atlas of the House and Immediate Environs'</text>, <text>But when a fight emerges between the two figures - Mister Monday and Sneezer - they both disappear without any further regard to Arthur</text>, <text>And from there, things just get stranger</text>, <text>A giant House has appeared on the block that only Arthur can see, and ugly dog-faced men in bowler hats are coming after him</text>, <text>Worse of all is the outbreak of a mysterious illness that puts the whole community into quarantine and Arthur's own family in danger</text>, <text>Seeing no other way of helping, Arthur travels to the House, uses his key, and enters its domain</text>, <text>Arthur has been chosen by the Will to become Heir to the Kingdom and set right the corruption that is destroying management of the realm</text>, <text>What follows is an amazing adventure throughout a world chock-full of danger, intrigue, invention and surprises</text>, <text>The House is one of the most colourful places you could ever wish to visit, complete with everything from elevators to dinosaurs to coal cellars</text>, <text>Nix delights in playing with words and concepts, and the phases \"got a frog in your throat\" and \"having a silver tongue\" take on whole new meaning here, and things such as books, paper, the written word and language are given a solid, tangible quality here that is thought-provoking and completely original</text>, <text>Old legends are given new life (such as the tale of the Pied Piper and the Greek myth of Prometheus) and concepts and symbols given real form: such as the days of the week in human form, and their angelic-looking (but quite devilish) Dawn, Noon and Dusks</text>, <text>Throughout, Arthur is a sympathetic, understandable protagonist, who reacts to his adventures in a way that you'd expect a young boy to do, but with extraordinary resilience and courage, as does his young sidekick Suzy Turquoise Blue</text>, <text>All other characters are vivid and interesting, both good and bad, and immensely memorable</text>, <text>Also, Nix sprinkles little hints and clues to the next books throughout the text, so read carefully!</text>, <text>The book suffers little from the amount of ideas and concepts that Nix crams between its covers, which can seem either random or confusing to a first-time reader</text>, <text>By the time they get on to the next books, the general formula of where Nix is going is straightened out and most of the things Arthur sees and hears of in this first book are understandable (which should justify a second reading!) Make sure \"Grim Tuesday\" is on hand to continue Arthur's story</text>, <text>This book was a delight at first to read, then it started to use issues that I think were very disgusting and since I am in 8th grade I refused to write my book report on this subject and discuss it in front of my piers</text>, <text>But if you're looking for a book about abortion and sex, this is the book for you</text>, <text>Termed \"America's New National Pastime\" by USA Weekend, basketball has come a long way since 1891, when a Massachusetts teacher experimented with an overinflated ball and a peach basket</text>, <text>This vibrantly illustrated and informative guide offers fans up-to-the-minute reporting on the 1995-96 season, superstar and team histories, stats, and more</text>, <text>160 color photos</text>, <text>This book is  porbably the 3 or 4th best book I've read,I am only 12 and I am already reading higher grade stuff</text>, <text>I recommend this book to any Mystery lover</text>, <text>Curtain: Poirot's last casePoirot's last case was written by Agatha Christie (1891-1976) in the 1940's</text>, <text>She's one of the worlds most read criminal authors, known as the queen of crime</text>, <text>She's written lots of detective stories and she's also used another name Mary Westmacott, under which she wrote six romantic novels</text>, <text>Poirot's last case takeS place at a small hotel called Styles, out In the countryside of England not too far away from London among people from the upper middle-class</text>, <text>Captain Hastings receives a letter from an old friend Hercules Poirot, a detective who has worked together with Hastings many times earlier</text>, <text>In the letter he urges Hasting to come to the hotel where they once met for the first time the Styles, because there is to be a murder</text>, <text>Lot's of things happen during the time when they try to solve the murder</text>, <text>All the people living at the hotel for the moment are somewhat involved in the matter of the murder</text>, <text>Hercules Poirot is a person that you never really get hold of during the story</text>, <text>He's described as a crippled old man and, even though he's old and can not walk, he still has his brain working</text>, <text>He's much more on the ball then you first think</text>, <text>Captain Hasting is a man that really appreciates seeing his old friend again but gets really confused sometimes and also he does believe in what every person says</text>, <text>I never get the feeling that he dislikes people, only one because he dislikes that mans manors</text>, <text>He seems to be quite naive and very trusting as his friend describes him</text>, <text>Other people are The Franklins, The Luttrells who are the owners of the hotel, Mr</text>, <text>Norton, Judith the captain's daughter, Boyd Carrington and Miss Cole</text>, <text>All are living at the hotel for one or another reason</text>, <text>The story is well written</text>, <text>You quickly get in to it but it's not that you can say what's going to happen</text>, <text>After half the book you will go on reading until the end because you want to know who the murderer is</text>, <text>That's where Agatha Christie shows what a good writer she is</text>, <text>She leaves you clues but it's only that we think we know who has done it, which in the end turns out to be completely wrong</text>, <text>The language she uses is fairly easy to understand</text>, <text>There are some words I did not know such as scientific words and some descriptive words</text>, <text>But the book is easy to read</text>, <text>The chapters are divided up well and you don't lose the line through out the story</text>, <text>I liked this book, it caught my interest quickly which for me is important</text>, <text>And it's an exciting story that holds your interest until the end</text>, <text>This was the first novel I read by Agatha Christie but I'll indeed read more of her</text>, <text>I would recommend her</text>, <text>This is the third novel I have read by Val McDermid</text>, <text>The first was, \"A Place Of Execution\", and it remains my favorite of the three</text>, <text>This newest offering, \"Last Temptation\", is a very good tale, but is definitely not for those readers who prefer to avoid the grisly details of murders, in this case those of a serial killer</text>, <text>There is also brutal violence with both men and women as victims, so read and be prepared</text>, <text>I don't find her descriptions to be gratuitous, just very graphic</text>, <text>He portrayals are probably much more accurate than generic description of violence that have become so prevalent and cliché that they are barely noticed</text>, <text>This author illustrates for the reader just how vile murder and violence are</text>, <text>This author uses atrocities committed by a group in the 20th century that I generally have tired of reading, as they have become the crutch for any form of evil</text>, <text>It is a tribute to this lady's talent that she has found a more obscure practice of the Germany of the Nazi's to play a very valid role in this novel</text>, <text>She also represents the evil of this group through the effects they have had on generations that were not even alive when they practiced their atrocities</text>, <text>Their twisted science echoes through the victims to their descendents, and this adds an entirely new dimension to the resonance of evil</text>, <text>The only aspect of the story I found troubling was the placement of the two main characters so close together while they were working on different operations</text>, <text>It makes the story work, but from the moment the situation is set, you know this is the Achilles heal that will bring the protagonists to the edge, or possibly over, to their detriment</text>, <text>I don't read many books in this type of genre, but Val McDermid seems as though her work should have a much greater following than it does</text>, <text>If this type of work appeals to you, pick this lady's work up; you will be happy you did</text>, <text>I like books with drama and stories that seem true, so I really liked this book</text>, <text>This book is an example of kids with problems and their friends problems all in one book</text>, <text>This was the first book that I read by Paul  Zindel and now he is one of my favorite authors</text>, <text>This was one of the best  books that I have read and I encourage other people to read it</text>, <text>cute board book for the cat lover or animal lover</text>, <text>author of \"Hobo Finds A Home\"</text>, <text>Val McDermid continues her 'Hill and Jordan' series with an entertaining story that combines a dangerous undercover assignment with an investigation of a serial killer, each of which leaves Tony and Carol on the verge of death!</text>, <text>McDermid does a pretty good job of integrating the two subplots, and her use of German and Dutch settings makes for a change from her usual 'real English locations with fictional names' approach</text>, <text>The two policewomen, Petra and Marijke, are among the most interesting characters, and their personal and professional relationship adds some color to the story</text>, <text>As for the 'bad guys', the smuggler Tadeusz and his crony Krazic, are suitably creepy, although the scenes featuring just the two of them are a bit slow</text>, <text>'Tadzio' has more chemistry with Carol</text>, <text>The 'serial killer' subplot is not quite as riveting as it might have been, relying on the coincidence of Tony knowing one of the victims</text>, <text>McDermid relies a bit too much on coincidental/convenient plot developments late in the book; as other reviewers have mentioned, the bad guys find out what Tony and Carol are really up to purely by chance, due to a careless mistake that neither Tony or Carol would otherwise make</text>, <text>Likewise, when both Tony and Carol are captured separately, both are left tied up, but only one is gagged, and that omision serves purely to advance the plot from a seemingly impossible situation)</text>, <text>The ending is satisfying for the most part, although it would have been nice to have a final scene with Petra and Marijke, since it's not likely McDermid will use them again</text>, <text>Despite the amount of 'suspension of disbelief' required in the final chapters, this is still a worthwhile entry in the series</text>, <text>The book Mister Monday by Garth Nix , was a very good book</text>, <text>Mister</text>, <text>Monday was fantasy</text>, <text>It all started when Arthur Penholgon was given a key and a atlas from</text>, <text>Mister Monday while Arthur was having a asthma attack and some fetchers</text>, <text>gave a plague called the sleepy plague</text>, <text>After that, Noon ( one of Mister</text>, <text>Monday's assistant ) sets fire to Arthur's school trying to get the key back</text>, <text>because the Will tricked Mister Monday into giving the key to Arthur, Noon</text>, <text>didn't get it but his Fetchers got the atlas</text>, <text>Then Arthur went inside a house that</text>, <text>was secretly another dimension</text>, <text>T here Arthur met a girl named Suzy Turquoise</text>, <text>Blue</text>, <text>After that, Arthur met Noon again with his brother and sister, Dawn and</text>, <text>Dusk who tried to get the key but could not because the key has already bonded</text>, <text>with Arthur which meant that they can't take it</text>, <text>Only Arthur could give it to</text>, <text>them so they sent him to the Deep Coal Cellar so they could torture him until he</text>, <text>gives them the key</text>, <text>While at The Deep Coal Center Arthur met the Old One and</text>, <text>Pravuil</text>, <text>Then here comes Suzy to the rescue</text>, <text>Arthur made some stairs to get out</text>, <text>and I am not aloud tell you the end so I won't</text>, <text>I thought this book was an okay book because it had old words like hip</text>, <text>I</text>, <text>think this book is for fifth graders because it was a little too kid like</text>, <text>I liked that</text>, <text>it was a good adventure</text>, <text>In the beginning there was The Architect who created everything from nothing</text>, <text>Eons passed, and then there was The Will</text>, <text>The Architect's Will was broken into seven pieces by the treacherous Trustees to prevent it from ever being executed</text>, <text>The first fragment was fused inside a solid crystal and then placed inside an unbreakable glass box which was locked inside an indestructible cage</text>, <text>The cage was anchored on the surface of a dead sun at the end of time, and was guarded by twelve sentinels, who were supervised by inspectors</text>, <text>These security measures may have been nothing to sneeze at, but sneeze the inspector did, and somehow the fragment escaped</text>, <text>Arthur Penhaligon was an asthmatic child who wasn't enjoying his first Monday at his new school</text>, <text>This was due to a sadistic teacher who forced him to run a cross-country course, resulting in a near death experience, during which he encountered the unlikely duo of Sneezer and Mister Monday</text>, <text>Suddenly he was the holder of a strange key, shaped like the minute hand of a clock, and Mister Monday was impatiently waiting for Arthur's expiry date to come up</text>, <text>After these exciting and intriguing introductions, Garth Nix launches into the meaty part of the first book of The Keys to the Kingdom series, where one of the most unlikely of heroes struggles reluctantly to fulfill his destiny, while trying to save his own world from a deadly plague</text>, <text>This story contains a great deal of violence, but fortunately while it is perfectly clear that pain is being inflicted with gleeful enjoyment and wanton abandon by Monday's associates, the descriptions are not graphic enough to be overly upsetting to the faint of heart</text>, <text>Young adult readers may be slightly confused by all the twists and machinations, but will still be thrilled by the adventures of Arthur and his friend Suzy Turquoise Blue as they negotiate the secrets of the House, guided by the Will, and armed with nothing but the Key, a great deal of common sense, and a very strong will to survive</text>, <text>Amanda Richards, June 23, 2006</text>, <text>I am Katie and I'm seven years old</text>, <text>This is one of the books that my dad read out loud to me at bedtime, but whenever he had to put it down, I begged him to read more</text>, <text>It was so exciting!</text>, <text>The story is about a little boy who was saved by one little key</text>, <text>He ventures into a very strange house that leads to a new world</text>, <text>Recommended for all people young and old who love adventure stories</text>, <text>Read the sequel, Grim Tuesday if you like this</text>, <text>I cannot wait till Drowned Wednesday comes out</text>, <text>Other reviewers have mentioned the Potter series, but this book reminded me more of Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy</text>, <text>As in HDM, the world is bleak, the heroes are young and most adults seem oblivious to anyone else, except as they may be used in some grandiose scheme</text>, <text>Unlike with HDM, I couldn't develop any integrated picture of the KTTK world</text>, <text>Things were described, but the descriptions seemed like prop lists</text>, <text>The author seemed capable of throwing in anything or anyone that we might have read about elsewhere</text>, <text>For example, Prometheus shows up - with a different name</text>, <text>At times, I felt like I was reading a screenplay, \"Hey, this'll look great in the film, (coming soon to a theater near you) and they probably have some on the backlot!\"  Maybe I should have called this 'Will and Dr</text>, <text>Who vs</text>, <text>Screwtape</text>, <text>'  I did want to find out how it turned out, so despite all criticisms, I think it probably works for the early teenager that hasn't already read everything in the genre</text>, <text>I must admit, I was a little weary of The Intruders when I first saw it: a cheesy front cover, with an inside flap that promised only what any other mystery novel could offer</text>, <text>However, when I started reading the first chapter, I didn't want to stop until I'd finished it</text>, <text>Marshall (who writes under several pen names, though is mostly known for the Straw Men trilogy) alternates between the stories a violent murder mystery, the ramblings of an over rational paranoid ex-cop whose wife may be missing, and the disappearance of a haunted little girl who acts nothing like a girl</text>, <text>What starts out as a series of random occurrences slowly forms into a solid mystery, and by mystery, I really mean mystery</text>, <text>The novel creeps along at a good pace, and the whole time there lingers the mixing tastes of a crime novel, a psychological thriller, and speculative fiction</text>, <text>I think for a novel to be a true \"mystery\" requires more than just a who-dunnit crime, or a highly intelligent detective; for a story to be a mystery, a writer must challenge his readers to uncover the state of reality, how horrific of a world the characters involved must live in</text>, <text>The world Marshall commits his novel to keeps the reader's attention by slowly unveiling possibilities that seem extra planar, or supernatural</text>, <text>Then, by diminishing his audience's reason, Marshall allows for a wide open thriller that presses on in relentless horror</text>, <text>At times violent, touching, and just plain creepy, The Intruders is the kind of novel that causes your brain to twitch in confusing glee</text>, <text>A must read for fans of subtlety in general, though anyone who enjoys a good dark mystery will find what he or she is looking for here</text>, <text>I like the MathStart Series *in general* but I wish there was more consistency from book to book</text>, <text>\"Henry the Fourth\" which explored ordinal numbers was great</text>, <text>The story had a cute plot and it kept my children's interest</text>, <text>\"Missing Mittens\"  (which was all about even and odd numbers) had a clumsy rhyme and it  wasn't nearly as good</text>, <text>This book about comparing-and-contrasting sizes is different still</text>, <text>It has too few words and virtually no plot</text>, <text>Take a look at the sentences from the first *3 pages*:</text>, <text>\"I am big</text>, <text>\"</text>, <text>\"I am bigger than you are</text>, <text>\"</text>, <text>\"I am the biggest bug by far</text>, <text>\"</text>, <text>Not much plot development there, and while the pictures detail  more activity, it is insufficient for young readers/viewers</text>, <text>On the bright side the `summary' pages are good</text>, <text>They show the 3 bugs currently under discussion (small, smaller, smallest, for example) in juxtaposition which makes it easy to talk about the concepts</text>, <text>So I would say that if you are willing to compose a story to go along with the pictures you can use this book to successfully teach your children about relative size</text>, <text>Without your input though they aren't going to get much out if it</text>, <text>Material covered in \"Best Bug Parade\":</text>, <text>Big, bigger, biggest</text>, <text>Small, smaller, smallest</text>, <text>Long, longer, longest</text>, <text>Short, shorter, shortest</text>, <text>Good, Better, Best</text>, <text>And as usual there are 2 pages of related activities suggested at the end of the book</text>, <text>Pam T~</text>, <text>After finishing the Abhorsen trilogy, I felt incomplete, as it should be with a good series, it leaves you hanging with anticipation</text>, <text>You hope to hear about what they're going to do next, but you realize \"</text>, <text>it's over?\" That was how I felt until I stumbled upon this series</text>, <text>These books have Garth Nix's classic prosaic style of writing, with interestingly new concepts woven in, the Morrow Days; Dawn, Noon and Dusk; and the Will</text>, <text>I was hooked from the very first page</text>, <text>That's what Garth Nix's books did for me</text>, <text>This concept of using time as a base for fantasy is not a new one, but I like the way it was done with this series</text>, <text>I read the books without the nagging feeling of \"</text>, <text>hey, this reminds me of Lord of the Rings</text>, <text>\" which gave me great hope for further reading of the series (well, if there is some anyways, don't tell me, I like living in my little world</text>, <text>)</text>, <text>But yeah, this idea about using keys for weapons, and Nothing</text>, <text>It makes me happy to see new material on the market</text>, <text>This book fully merits 5 stars</text>, <text>I hope you read this book and enjoy it as immensely as I have</text>, <text>Mark R Guthrie</text>, <text>Its girl! It's actually two girls</text>, <text>Twins: Angela and Diabla</text>, <text>Angela is as sweet as an angel and , her twin sister, Diabla is the opposite</text>, <text>Diabla  always throws things at Angela, but Angela still loves her anyway</text>, <text>Angela always want to be with be with her sister Diabla</text>, <text>When Angela and Diabla are together it calms diabla down</text>, <text>Diabla can make things cacth on fire and make buildings fall down</text>, <text>But when Angela is around Diabla can't do any harm to anyone</text>, <text>I realy enjoed this book</text>, <text>If you like contmporary fiction, you might enjoy Angela and Diabla</text>, <text>I liked the story, but it lacked the detail and depth that can be found in Tolkien and Rowling</text>, <text>A bit more story and it could reach their level easily</text>, <text>As it is, it will take the series as a whole to compete the depth if it goes on as is</text>, <text>A story should leave you wanting more, but this left me knowing I wasn't going to get any more from the first segment only the story as a whole would grow</text>, <text>It's a shame cause I think the author has created in this story a work that could have become a classic epic within the genre</text>, <text>Now, it's simply a good read that could have been great</text>, <text>Thi book is great</text>, <text>It is about twins</text>, <text>Angela is sweet and caring and kind</text>, <text>Diabola is the devil</text>, <text>Lynne Reid Banks did a great job on it</text>, <text>It is a great idea and the details are really funny</text>, <text>It is a little violent though</text>, <text>I  suggest this book should be read by 7 years olds and up</text>, <text>It really isn't  confusing though</text>, <text>This book shows the struggle of a family that has been  blessed and been punished</text>, <text>Angela is mature and comforts her parents</text>, <text>Diabola hates everyone and is mean</text>, <text>But no matter what Angela loves  Diabola, even when Diabola trys to kill her</text>, <text>When Angela is near Diabola,  she can't do anything wrong</text>, <text>Angela got all the goodness and Diabola got  all the badness</text>, <text>Each person is good and bad</text>, <text>But these girls aren't</text>, <text>Diabola is a terror and the only person that can stop her is Angela</text>, <text>The  story is sad</text>, <text>but it is also impossible to put down</text>, <text>Itis one ofmy favorite  books</text>, <text>For some reason I think Angela needed badness more then Diabola  needed goodness</text>, <text>Diabola hates her sister and is getting to be very  powerful</text>, <text>But  so is Angela</text>, <text>I hate not being able to say all the details  but I don't want to ruin the book for you</text>, <text>so whats stoping you</text>, <text>get the  book today</text>, <text>if you don't read this book then you will never read a book  that has sadness, badness, goodnes, and lotsof other things, all mixed  together</text>, <text>This book was not at all that I would imagine it to be! It was kind of scary, so i had to read it in the daylight! This story was about two twins- One good and one very, very bad! Their names were Angela and Diabola</text>, <text>Angela means angel, and she was obviously the good one</text>, <text>People's hearts melted when they saw her and it made other mothers jealous</text>, <text>Diabola, on the other hand, was a complete Devil</text>, <text>She slept in a cage, wished that people would die and drew gory, disgusting pictures</text>, <text>The story contniues until the girls get to kindergarden</text>, <text>They soon discover that they have special powers</text>, <text>But with Diabola, this could be a problem</text>, <text>Can Angela stop Diabola before its too late? Or will Diabola destroy the city? Read Angela and Diabola, by Lynn Reid Banks and find out!</text>, <text>I have to agree with the review by Someone's Mom</text>, <text>While this book does provide many interesting and valid points - some which I agree with, some I do not - I feel this book is not focused enough and lacks an overall thesis</text>, <text>The author states many 'facts' and points that seemed to backed up very little other than personal views or opinion (or at least they aren't explained throroughly enough for me to undertstand</text>, <text>) I also feel that there is too much generalization - the author does not give much credit to individual choices &amp; feelings</text>, <text>I am a woman who would like to marry her partner and I feel that many of her descriptions do no apply to me at all</text>, <text>So once again, I don't think that the views expressed in this book are invalid by any means, but they offer little in the way of concrete argument</text>, <text>&lt;DIV&gt;In 1750, Scotland emerged from half a century of civil strife</text>, <text>Its parliament was subsumed by Westminster, and the English were vigilant for any sign of Jacobite rebellion</text>, <text>Despite this, Scotland was at the beginning of a period of resurgence that was to last two centuries</text>, <text>This fascinating look at of the Golden Age of Scottish history includes: the great names of the “democratic intellect,” including Adam Smith and David Hume; writers, such as Robert Burns, Walter Scott, and Robert Louis Stevenson; scientists and inventors, among them Watson and Watt; as well as engineers of the Empire; missionaries and explorers; and pioneers of surgery and medicine</text>, <text>An illuminating account of the outstanding achievements of this proud nation</text>, <text>&lt;/DIV&gt;</text>, <text>In My Darling, My Hamburger, they talk about many topics amoung teens today</text>, <text>In the book a senior named Liz faces problems like: I love my boy friend, but do I love him enough to have sex with him; and If I do get pregnant what will I do? Will I have the baby or get an abortion?  Paul Zindel did a great job writting this book</text>, <text>It expresses many problems that teens face today like dating, sex, teenage pregnancy, and many others</text>, <text>This book was one of the best books I have read ever</text>, <text>The story of Angela and Diabola all begins when Mrs</text>, <text>Cuthertston-Jones gives birth to  twins with completly different personalities, one of the  twins was born an angel and was named Angela where as her twin sister was  born a devil and was named Diabola</text>, <text>Their parents knew they had to find a  way to make Angela and Diabola be part good and part bad</text>, <text>After a while Mr</text>, <text>and Mrs</text>, <text>Cuthertson-Jones figured out that Angela and Diabola can only  balance by being around each other</text>, <text>As the twins get older they start to  balance</text>, <text>Just when things are getting way out of control Angela and Diabola  start to balance themselves</text>, <text>I really liked this book because it was  interesting and always kept me entertained</text>, <text>I also liked this book because  it is funny and it's not too long</text>, <text>This book is a confusing book</text>, <text>At first it is funny</text>, <text>But then it gets real confusing</text>, <text>Lynne Reid</text>, <text>Banks has writin better books than this book,</text>, <text>I belive</text>, <text>I mean what happened to Diabola?</text>, <text>Was she just dead? Were they happy 'cause</text>, <text>she was dead? What happened to the vicar?</text>, <text>I think this book is a bit violent too</text>, <text>Diabola tries</text>, <text>to kill her own sister and draws violent things</text>, <text>too</text>, <text>If one of my friends would ask if this was a</text>, <text>good book, I would say \"I've read better</text>, <text>\"</text>, <text>This was a great book, which really pulls the reader in! Nix has done a great job with the adventure aspect of the novel, and there are many fantastic (if fantastically evil) creatures, described in detail in their essence and physical aspects included</text>, <text>It is a true heaven to those who love fantasy adventure  novels, the rough story is as follows:</text>, <text>Arthur Penhaligon, an asmathic seventh grader is an intersting character, with a very unordinary life</text>, <text>One day, he is handed the Key and the Atlas, and the fate of his world falls on his shoulders, as a fatal plague sweeps the area</text>, <text>The fast and intense plot makes the book absolutely captivating, as Arthur finds out just how deep his adventure goes</text>, <text>It was a wonderful book, as was its sequel, Grim Tuesday</text>, <text>I have not read any further, but these two have persuaded me to pursue this series, and i hope it will motivate many others to as well</text>, <text>The exhaustive and definitive guide to the entire works of C</text>, <text>S</text>, <text>Lewis, including Narnia, the science fiction and the literary works</text>, <text>Known worldwide for The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and the other Chronicles of Narnia, C</text>, <text>S</text>, <text>Lewis was also a broadcaster and prolific writer of literary criticism, science fiction, letters and religious themes, and his books continue to sell in their thousands, attracting generation after generation of new admirers</text>, <text>This definitive handbook, written by one of the world's leading authorities on C</text>, <text>S</text>, <text>Lewis, is a meticulous, informative and enjoyable resource for study and general reference</text>, <text>It includes: / A chronology of the events of Lewis's life and a brief biography / Detailed descriptions of the background, contents and critical reception of each of his books / An overview of Lewis's key ideas / A Who's Who of people in Lewis's life and a What's What of locations and events / An exhaustive bibliography of all his writings</text>, <text>This was an extremely fun read</text>, <text>As a longtime fan of McDonalds work, I must confess that his Son of Fletch work of the last few years hasn't grabbed me</text>, <text>Skylar, on the other hand, is a breath of fresh air (sorry for  the cliche)</text>, <text>McDonald has found new energy in Skylar</text>, <text>I hope we see more of  him</text>, <text>Val McDermid's latest novel, \"The Last Temptation,\" is an ambitious undertaking</text>, <text>The author crosses geographical boundaries; her plot lines involve police forces in England, Holland and Germany</text>, <text>This novel also has numerous characters and several storylines that at first seem unrelated, but which eventually intersect</text>, <text>Carol Jordan is an ambitious Detective Chief Inspector who is well trained in criminal intelligence</text>, <text>Jordan has helped bring two serial killers to justice and she has paid her dues as a police officer</text>, <text>Now, she is aiming for a high-level job in British intelligence and analysis, and she is expecting a promotion to come through very soon</text>, <text>Much to her surprise, Jordan is not granted her promotion</text>, <text>Instead she is sent into deep undercover to bring down a notorious criminal named Tadeusz Radecki and his right hand man Darko Krasic, who are based in Germany</text>, <text>A second protagonist in \"The Last Temptation\" is Dr</text>, <text>Tony Hill, a psychologist who has been deeply scarred by his job of profiling serial killers</text>, <text>He is now on the trail of a criminal who targets psychologists and murders them in a particularly gruesome manner</text>, <text>Hill and Jordan have collaborated professionally in the past</text>, <text>As they work these difficult cases, Jordan and Hill provide one another with much needed advice and emotional support</text>, <text>McDermid handles her large cast of characters and a complex plot adroitly</text>, <text>Her dialogue is crisp and her descriptive writing is vivid yet understated</text>, <text>The author ratchets up the tension as the novel reaches its exciting denouement</text>, <text>Unfortunately, McDermid resorts to a pat ending, which strains believability</text>, <text>However, this quibble aside, I recommend \"The Last Temptation</text>, <text>\"  McDermid's skill as a writer of fast-paced and well-crafted thrillers makes this new novel a \"must-read\" for fans of this genre</text>, <text>I didn't like this book and the Northwest setting of Portland and Seattle made me think the author had spent an afternoon in the Northwest during a cruise ship pit stop and decided he could write about the location like a native</text>, <text>Unlikeable, dour and sour characters populate this novel that has SciFi/Horror overtones set in something of a hardboiled mystery</text>, <text>None of really succeeds</text>, <text>I was curious to see whether \"Mister Monday\" (first novel in a fantasy series that has since worked its way up to Thursday) was published before or after James Stoddard's \"High House\" as the two books have similar settings</text>, <text>Stoddard came first, but Garth Nix has put his unique stamp on the 'Universe manifested as a queer old House' theme</text>, <text>That said, this \"Keys to the Kingdom\" series is more disjointed and less appealing than Garth Nix's Abhorsen trilogy</text>, <text>\"Mister Monday\" reminds me more of \"The Ragwitch\" in that a young boy with absolutely no training learns that he is the Rightful Heir to some improbable kingdom (the Universe) and is also the only person on Earth who can stop/cure the newest, deadliest plague</text>, <text>Naturally Arthur wants to concentrate on curing the plague, since his own family is involved</text>, <text>Then he is saved from a lethal asthma attack by a man in a bath chair wielding the minute hand off of a gigantic clock</text>, <text>The man in the bath chair is Mr</text>, <text>Monday and he is being pushed about by his butler, Sneezer</text>, <text>These two men spend the rest of the book chasing Arthur through a sort of Victorian workers' hell, trying to get him to return the Key (the minute hand) to Mr</text>, <text>Monday</text>, <text>The book has lots of interesting magic, blue-and-yellow-striped dinosaurs, an angry old man who is chained to a gigantic clock, and a pair of truly macabre creatures who gouge out the old man's eyes every day at 12 o'clock</text>, <text>(His eyes grow back</text>, <text>Does this man remind you of Prometheus, kiddies?)</text>, <text>Arthur must get through some horrifying trials to save his Earth from the plague, and to prove that he is the Rightful Heir</text>, <text>He shows that he has the Right Stuff--after all, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday have already been written--but this first book suffers from a multiplicity of themes</text>, <text>The author seems to have tried out several different settings (Victorian policemen and a sort of Bob Cratchit universe, along with dinosaurs, good and bad angels, and a really stinky and terrifying Roman bathhouse), then didn't want to discard anything</text>, <text>So, here it all is in \"Mister Monday</text>, <text>\"</text>, <text>I'm still debating as to whether I want to advance on to \"Grim Tuesday</text>, <text>\" Arthur has already saved my world from the Sleepy Plague and I'm not particularly taken with the rest of Nix's mixed-up Universe</text>, <text>I like this book because it has action, suspense and a little bit of drama</text>, <text>What I liked most is the thematic of the book which says that \"Everything came from Nothing\" because it tries to explain the origin of the universe</text>, <text>The hero of the story is a normal kid who finds out that he himself is the heir to the power of the \"Architec\" the being that created all of the universe</text>, <text>After the Fetchers bring a disease to his planet Arthur starts his adventure in search of the cure for the deadly disease</text>, <text>This book is nice for schoolchildren because it teaches them good values</text>, <text>Author Anne Kingston deserves five stars-plus for her exhaustive research and objective presentation of the subject</text>, <text>The Meaning of Wife, which is by no means a quick or light read, is well written, engaging, thought provoking and entertaining</text>, <text>If you are a wife, you'll find yourself somewhere in these pages</text>, <text>If you're not a wife, you may recognize your mother or your friends, or the woman you call your wife</text>, <text>Kingston covers all the bases, beginning with the world's fascination with Princess Diana's foray into wifedom</text>, <text>In a chapter called \"Heart of Whiteness,\" which is what I've always called \"White Lace Dreams,\" she details the wedding dress selection and compares the white lacy dress to the wedding cake</text>, <text>\"The modern wedding cake is a bride you can put in your mouth,\" is a quote attributed to food writer Jeffrey Steingarten</text>, <text>From there, the topics of sex and abuse, divorce and value are thoroughly portrayed</text>, <text>Strong vocabulary, this is academic material</text>, <text>Well done</text>, <text>I'll admit it</text>, <text>the cover is what first drew me to this book</text>, <text>I liked the glowing clock hands and the fog with the creepy things standing in it</text>, <text>Then I flipped it over and read that the main character, Arthur Penhaligon, was supposed to die, yet he didn't</text>, <text>Instantly, I was intrigued</text>, <text>Arthur has asthma, which is something I can relate to since I had it as a kid too</text>, <text>He pushes himself too hard because he doesn't want to feel alienated by his weaker lungs</text>, <text>It's an asthma attack that almost kills him, but he is saved through the efforts of a small piece of a Will and a key shaped like the minute hand of a clock</text>, <text>Soon after the arrival of the key come those who wish to hunt it down and return it to Mister Monday</text>, <text>Among those are the army of doglike and winged creatures, all dressed in attire befitting a civilization one hundred and fifty years ago</text>, <text>With them they bring the sleepy plague that begins to overtake Arthur's homeland</text>, <text>Arthur uses the key to enter into a mysterious house (that only he can see) in hopes of finding a cure</text>, <text>There he discovers a world beautifully ripe with clockwork imagery and centralized around the written word</text>, <text>Those that reside there trade in paper and ink materials instead of money</text>, <text>Plus there are ever present characters of Monday's army, such as Dawn, Noon, and Dusk</text>, <text>Although I liked the concept of this book, I found Arthur's overall journey to be a bit too contrived and that he is led where he goes simply because the author placed him on that path and not because it was the pull of the character leading us on his story</text>, <text>Overall, despite the quirky environment and characters, the story felt predictable and a bit templated in its structure</text>, <text>I also picked up on a religious tone to the book, which I only mention to make you aware that it's in there</text>, <text>I did find the setting fun to visualize and it is because of that, I will be checking out Grim Tuesday next</text>, <text>This is a terrific series, more adult than the Tower one and more imaginative than the Abhorsen group</text>, <text>Wish the next one -- Drowned Wednesday -- would  hurry up and arrive</text>, <text>It was a very dark and mysterious book, but it kept me gripped all the way through</text>, <text>It has a realistic sort of character, because everyone is expecting him to save the world, but he has no idea what to do or where to go</text>, <text>He just wants to be a normal kid with a normal life, but is sucked into this world of magic and mystery, which he cannot escape</text>, <text>Garth Nix is a very good author, and he seems to have found his nook with this series</text>, <text>I enjoyed this book, but I think it was a bit confusing to follow</text>, <text>I recommend this for fans of fantasy, or other books by Garth Nix</text>, <text>I have read the three books in this series currently out, and am eagerly awaiting to read \"Sir Thursday,\" the fourth book</text>, <text>Based on historical fact, WINSTON'S WAR is a solid and absorbing fictional rendition of the leadership struggle between Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and Winston Churchill between October 1, 1938 and May 10, 1940</text>, <text>As the book opens, Chamberlain has returned to 10 Downing Street a public hero after the signing of the Munich Agreement between himself and Adolf Hitler which gave the latter the Sudetenland in return for \"peace in our time\"</text>, <text>Meanwhile, relegated to the periphery of British politics and virtually an outcast, Churchill obstinately lashes out against appeasement and loudly proclaims the necessity for total war to save democracy from the depredations of the Nazis</text>, <text>What subsequently follows is history: the German subjugation of the rest of Czechoslovakia and the invasion of Poland, the German-Soviet non-aggression pact, the Phony War, the Soviet invasion of Finland, the British military's Norwegian fiasco, and the crisis in His Majasty's government in May 1940 that ultimately elevated Winston to the premiership</text>, <text>The cast of characters in this sweeping story by Michael Dobbs of political maneuvering, skullduggery, and backstabbing is an historical Who's Who of the times: the ailing, haughty, and pacifist Chamberlain, who personifies England's bitter memories of the Great War and the popular concept of \"never again\"; the ambitious and self-absorbed Churchill, whose pugnacity sometimes clouds prudence; the defeatist, philandering, and anti-Semitic U</text>, <text>S</text>, <text>Ambassador to the Court of St</text>, <text>James, Joseph P</text>, <text>Kennedy; the alcoholic, disillusioned and psychologically tortured idealist, Guy Burgess (of Burgess, Philby, and Maclean of Cold War infamy); the stuttering King George VI, who whines that the German invasion of Poland interrupted his grouse hunting; and the Machiavellian newspaper mogul, William \"Max\" Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook</text>, <text>It's in the minor details with which Dobbs fleshes out the story of Chamberlain's fall and the rise of his nemesis, Churchill, to an epic 685 paper-backed pages (UK HarperCollins edition)</text>, <text>And it's the length of WINSTON'S WAR that is, perhaps, a minor flaw</text>, <text>Some of the subplots seemed unnecessary, and should have been severely cropped by a ruthless editor: the love affair between the crippled WWI survivor \"Mac\" McFadden, barber to the politically great and one of Guy's information sources, and Carol, a housemaid and part-time prostitute; and between Bournemouth postmistress Sue Graham and Army Sergeant Jerry White - though the experiences of the latter did usefully tie the Norway debacle into the storyline on a personal level</text>, <text>Slightly more relevant, but still mildly tedious, was the dysfunctional relationship between Brendan Bracken, Churchill's closest confidant, and Kennedy's niece, Anna Fitzgerald</text>, <text>Perhaps Dobbs perceived a need to include Carol, Sue and Anna to make it less of a Guy Read</text>, <text>Chamberlain was toppled not because he sought to appease Hitler and avert a cataclysm, but because he didn't have the mettle to wage all-out war when the necessity for it was thrust upon him</text>, <text>That was to prove to be Winston's genius</text>, <text>The author's genius is in portraying the labyrinthine venality of Whitehall and Fleet Street powerbroking at a time when solidarity against a rapacious common  enemy was desperately necessary</text>, <text>WINSTON'S WAR is the first in a series of novels about Churchill's wartime leadership</text>, <text>According to the back cover, the next book is apparently NEVER SURRENDER</text>, <text>I shall seek out and buy it immediately</text>, <text>This was a really great book</text>, <text>I never suspected the killer to be who she was</text>, <text>Great book, check it out ;</text>, <text>This novel is one that cannot go undread by young men and women alike</text>, <text>It introduces the consequences of seemingly innocent actions and captures the reader's undivided attention from page one</text>, <text>By the end of the novel, the reader will feel as though he or she knows the characters and cares for what becomes of them</text>, <text>While Garth Nix's fictional characters often have magical powers he, too, has a power - the power to create fantasy tales that have earned him a host of young fans</text>, <text>And, screen actor Allan Corduner has the power to imbue his reading of the latest by this talented author with the requisite amounts of menace and suspense</text>, <text>Young Arthur Penhaligon is an asthmatic</text>, <text>His future doesn't appear bright; it becomes even darker when he has an otherworldly encounter with a strange man who leaves him with a key shaped like a clock's minute hand</text>, <text>What could be more innocuous than a small key?  But, wait, the key seems to have a terrifying effect on the world as it brings with it a plague</text>, <text>Soon Arthur is besieged by a Mister Monday and a band of vengeance seekers with blood-stained wings</text>, <text>As if that were not enough, dog-faced Fetchers pursue him</text>, <text>Arthur seeks safety within the walls of a house that only he can see</text>, <text>There are a myriad of secrets within these walls and uncounted mysteries attached to the key</text>, <text>Can he save himself and keep the key from the sinister Mr</text>, <text>Monday?\tGarth Nix has done it again with this sure to top the lists yarn</text>, <text>- Gail Cooke</text>, <text>I've had this book in my library since it was first published</text>, <text>Carolyn herself autographed it for me in '82</text>, <text>In all the moves and changes over the years, I could never justify getting rid of it</text>, <text>It's the best, most usable book on desert edibles I've ever read or owned</text>, <text>Here's a breakdown:</text>, <text>1</text>, <text>Cactus and cactuslike plants - agave, barrel, cholla, etc</text>, <text>2</text>, <text>Nuts and seeds - acorn, grass seed, jojoba, etc</text>, <text>3</text>, <text>Grapes, berries and cherries - chokecherry, wild currant, etc</text>, <text>4</text>, <text>Foods of the marsh and mesa - buffalo gourd, cattail, cota, etc</text>, <text>5</text>, <text>greens - Rocky Mountain Beeweed, Canaigre, Curly dock, etc</text>, <text>6</text>, <text>Agriculture - beans, chili, corn, etc</text>, <text>Let's take a look at page 10, Cholla</text>, <text>Wonderful, detailed illustration - if you can't find the plant by these pictures, you're not trying</text>, <text>Common name, scientific names, habitat and description</text>, <text>First Para</text>, <text>:</text>, <text>\"Indians sometimes called early spring - March - 'the cactus moon' because food was scarce, and this plant was often the only available vegetable food</text>, <text>\" Etc</text>, <text>Next page, she spells out how to harvest and clean the buds for food</text>, <text>Cholla buds - basic preparation</text>, <text>Next recipe:  cholla buds and squash</text>, <text>One of my favorite recipe in the book is Prickly Pear jelly - oh, yum!!!</text>, <text>This is the book for anyone who doesn't know a wild grape from a hackberry</text>, <text>It even has a recipe for Dandelion Wine</text>, <text>It's a wonderful blend of desert culture and how-tos</text>, <text>How can you go wrong with that?</text>, <text>My old, tattered book is filled with specimens from my own desert excursions</text>, <text>It's been dog-eared, noted, dirtied and loved</text>, <text>It will be one book I'll never give up</text>, <text>I don't read much mystery or suspense, usually because the writer doesn't take the time to create characters that are more than two dimensional or flesh out the world around them</text>, <text>This author did both, and added  a plot that, as others have pointed out, grows satisfyingly creepier on each page -- so much so that I found myself standing at a cross-walk in broad daylight thinking, \"I really need to start paying more attention to who's around me</text>, <text>\"  By crossing and recrossing the fine line between ordinary weirdness and quantum weirdness, it kept me guessing well into the late stages</text>, <text>Yes, it's long, but I read the last 130 pages in one sitting on the edge of my seat</text>, <text>This is an execellent book about teenagers and all the usual problems teens go through</text>, <text>One of those problems is dating and sex</text>, <text>A girl and her boyfriend decide to take that step but they don't think of the consequences</text>, <text>Read the book to find out what happens!!  I liked the book because it was about teenagers so I felt I could relate to the story</text>, <text>I give this book 4 stars</text>, <text>Former LAPD cop turned author Jack Whalen and his wife advertising executive Amy left Southern California to live in the Seattle suburbs</text>, <text>One seemingly uneventful day high school sports friend Gary Fisher calls from Chicago to ask Jack to do him a favor</text>, <text>The lawyer says he tracked Jack from his book and would like Jack to investigate the brutal murders of thirty-seven year old Gina Anderson and her son Joshua in their Seattle home; the house was trashed and the husband a lecturer at the nearby community college vanished</text>, <text>Jack agrees to take the case, but when he calls his wife who is in Seattle on business, the hotel desk clerk says she has not checked in and she fails to answer her cell phone</text>, <text>Concerned he travels to Seattle to find Amy has vanished</text>, <text>In Portland, a nine years old girl also disappears, but is found a few miles away</text>, <text>She shares visions with Jack, who digs deeper into a cesspool in search of his wife</text>, <text>Soon all three scenarios will connect at the heart of Jack's soul</text>, <text>THE INTRUDERS affirm Michael Marshall's winning of the Philip K</text>, <text>Dick</text>, <text>Award (see THE STRAW MEN) as this action-packed thriller filled with twists will keep readers on the edge throughout</text>, <text>Jack is a wonderful beleaguered hero who starts off by quickly realizing he don't know jack even about himself and as he investigates realizes each new clue proves he knows even less than he thought</text>, <text>The audience needs to set aside plenty of time as 392 pages is a one sitting suspense read</text>, <text>Harriet Klausner</text>, <text>In my opinion, this is the best and most well written of all of the Capone biographies</text>, <text>The first few pages of this highly engrossing book takes the reader to the front door of the Lexington Hotel, Capone's headquarters</text>, <text>on into the inner sactum of the gangleader himself</text>, <text>The story of Al Capone is brilliantly laid out in an easy to follow format that takes the reader through Capone's life and motivations</text>, <text>I've read all of the major bios on \"Big Al\" and this is by far the best</text>, <text>highly recommended</text>, <text>Well into the nineteenth century, a wife was subsumed within a husband's legal standing and control, quite literally an existence not far from slavery</text>, <text>In the twentieth century, fueled by the high percentage of women entering the workforce and the women's movement over the last forty years, the concept of being a wife, both socially and legally, has undergone considerable examination and change</text>, <text>This book is a wide-ranging look at different aspects of being a wife or the contemplation of such</text>, <text>The author makes clear that the meaning of wife is inseparable from images of women from a variety of sources, including corporate advertising, movies, books, etc</text>, <text>A comprehensive bridal industry has emerged that emphasizes the perfect, elaborate wedding as being the foremost aspect of a marriage, shoving long-term, wifely realities to the background - the escapist wedding of Princess Diana being the epitome of that notion</text>, <text>In addition, wives can now supposedly rise beyond mundane drudgery by becoming domestic experts as directed by Martha Stewart and the like - a Superwife</text>, <text>The author notes a curious reversal of sentiments among highly educated younger women, who are more and more eschewing independent careers advocated by feminism to become wives</text>, <text>There are any numbers of books and consultants to give advice to make that happen while the \"clock is ticking</text>, <text>\" On the other hand, there is a discernible rise in women remaining single in the western world</text>, <text>While there is the pull of marital domesticity, the terms are now different</text>, <text>Women have achieved the wherewithal, both psychologically and legally, to be assertive concerning such matters as sexual satisfaction, infidelity, abuse, and divorce settlements</text>, <text>There is no doubt that the book is geared to women of the upper middle class, highly educated and consumers of various media depicting roles for women</text>, <text>One suspects that for those women whose job is an absolute necessity, that choosing to stay at home after becoming a lawyer or investing time to make special decorations for the perfect dinner party is hardly understandable or pertinent</text>, <text>There are a lot of considerations and views concerning the role of individuals in a marriage or whether to remain single</text>, <text>There remains a \"wife gap\" in trying to reconcile all of the aspects</text>, <text>The book does a fair job at examining some of the terrain</text>, <text>The author does ultimately admit that there is \"no singular meaning of wife</text>, <text>\" So be warned, the matter remains complicated even after reading this book</text>, <text>i love this book and would reccomend it to any teenage person</text>, <text>male or female</text>, <text>i usually hate stories of teenage life, but this was very good</text>, <text>highly recommended!</text>, <text>I previously read 'The Straw Men' by Michael Marshall and really enjoyed it</text>, <text>I looked him up to see if he had written anything else and was excited to pick up a copy of 'The Intruders', but how quickly that feeling waned once I started reading</text>, <text>Jack Whalen and his wife Amy live in Birch Crossing in Washington</text>, <text>Jack is a former LA cop turned writer and Amy works in Marketing</text>, <text>She is on a business trip and Jack gets a call from a Seattle cab driver telling him that his wife forgot her cell phone in his cab</text>, <text>When Jack calls the hotel where Amy is supposed to be staying he learns she was never booked there</text>, <text>A few phone calls and mysterious video messages later, Jack sets off on a journey to find his wife and learn what she is involved in, and with whom</text>, <text>At the same time, Madison O'Donnell is approached by a man in black while on the beach near her parten's summer home in Oregon</text>, <text>After her brief meeting with this man, Madison starts blacking out and having odd feelings</text>, <text>She ends up getting herself to Seattle and doing crazy things that no one would expect from a little girl</text>, <text>Marshall tries to weave a sci-fi tale that comes across as an attempt to master a genre he knows little about</text>, <text>His jumps from character to character and scene to scene are not well put together</text>, <text>I did not enjoy this book very much at all</text>, <text>I really had to push myself to finish it and as I was reading felt constantly confused and hoping it would end soo</text>, <text>I did not enjoy this book half as much as i have enjoyed her previous books</text>, <text>However, that does not mean it is a bad book</text>, <text>It is actually a very good book, one that i expect will appeal to many people</text>, <text>But it is not what i was expecting, nor what i was looking forward to, and hence i am disappointed</text>, <text>The basic plot goes thus: Carol Jordan is sent to Berlin on an undercover covert operation to trap an evil traffiker in both drugs and humans</text>, <text>Her bosses think she will be able to handle it</text>, <text>During the job she will be almost completely cut off from everybody, and will feel very alone</text>, <text>Her peril's are increased when the actions of her superiours put her in mortal danger</text>, <text>Alongside that, psychologists are being murdered on the contient</text>, <text>Murdered horribly, with no apparent motive</text>, <text>It is when an ex colleage of profiler Tony Hill's is found slain that he takes it upon himself to investigate the killings</text>, <text>The emotionally tangled pair must both tackle their own monsters with little help from anyone else and both of them, Carol in particular, will face great personal danger</text>, <text>It is a very well written book, that is undeniable</text>, <text>However, i cannot say that it is as atmospheric as \"A Place of Execution\" or as scary and original as \"Killing the Shadows\", but it is thrilling in a hard-edged way</text>, <text>But</text>, <text>McDermid concentrates far too much on Carol Jordan's side of the book, and not nearly enough on the serial killer aspect of the plot, which is what she is known for, and what she does best</text>, <text>As such, the serial killer nit about the psychologists getting killed seems underdeveloped and at times just incidental</text>, <text>Instead of the tense serial killer novel we expect, we are given a novel mainly about the criminal underworld and undercover policing</text>, <text>Many people will greatly enjoy this aspect of the book</text>, <text>And if so, i cannot reccomend it highly enough to you</text>, <text>But, if you are expecting a nice meaty serial killer novel, reasses your beliefs quickly, because it is not what you're going to get</text>, <text>Actually a very good novel, just not what i was expecting</text>, <text>I would have preferred more emphasis on Tony Hill's aspect of the book, but we don't always get what we want, and this book certainly displays Carol Jordan's full abilites</text>, <text>I picked up Mister Monday with many preconceived notions</text>, <text>It seemed a little young for me, but since I like Garth Nix so much, I decided to give it a try</text>, <text>I'm very glad I did, because this book turned out to be much more than I expected</text>, <text>It was full of action and twists and turns, very satisfying</text>, <text>I gave it 4 stars only because it doesn't top my favorite Garth Nix book, \"Shade's Children</text>, <text>\"  I recommend this and \"Shade's Children\" to everyone who likes an action packed book</text>, <text>Mister Monday by Garth Nix is one of the best books I have ever read</text>, <text>It's a story of a middle school aged kid named Arthur</text>, <text>He's pretty normal except for his dad use to be in a rock band and his mom is one of the most famous doctors in the world</text>, <text>One day while in gym class he has an asthma attack and passes out while people are running to get help a man in a wheel chair and another odd looking man appear</text>, <text>The man in the wheel chair gives Arthur a key, and they disappear again, while holding the key Arthur can breathe perfectly fine</text>, <text>After spending a couple days in the hospital he finds a notebook in his jacket pocket when he held the key and opened the book he sees a drawing of a house that nobody else can see</text>, <text>When he goes the house and touches the key to the wall a black door appears he walks in it and goes to another world</text>, <text>The whole book is about him saving this world because an evil man named mister Monday has unleashed pieces of a will this should be trapped up forever</text>, <text>In the end Arthur defeats Mister Monday and saves the lower house, but there are more days of the week to be stopped</text>, <text>I thought this was a great book it had non-stop action</text>, <text>On of the greatest scenes of action is when Arthur and Mister Monday are fighting, the descriptiveness was so vivid I thought I was watching them the whole time</text>, <text>Another scene is when Arthur is being chased by creatures called Nithlings, he is saved by a friend and it explains really well how Arthur quickly climbed a rope and threw tiles at the creatures</text>, <text>Another cool part of the story is how he described the landscapes that were in the book</text>, <text>He would quickly and efficiently describe every place they went, not like some stories where the spend pages describing one little thing</text>, <text>Like when Arthur first got to the House, as everyone called the world he went to, the author quickly described where he appeared but I could vividly see it in my head</text>, <text>Or when Arthur first went in to Mister Monday's dayroom to fight him, thought there wasn't much to it, I knew exactly what it looked like so as the said where they were I understood it like it was my own home</text>, <text>Finally how everyone changed over the story, the characters in this story changed a lot in through the story</text>, <text>First of all Arthur who changed from assort of goofy asthmatic kid who couldn't run or fight in to a great hero</text>, <text>Suzy, one of Arthur's allies through out the story, changed from working at a crappy job to helping save the world</text>, <text>Mister Monday changed from a ruler of many to be a pathetic man grobbling for his life in front of Arthur</text>, <text>So all in all this was a great book I would recommend it to anyone</text>, <text>Even though it's a little long it can be read quickly because of how interesting it is</text>, <text>So my recommendation is to anyone who likes to amazed</text>, <text>S</text>, <text>Bricker</text>, <text>It's often difficult to find an author who is willing to address the \"dark\" side of girlhood</text>, <text>It's virtually impossible to find an author who will address the NEED for that \"dark\" side</text>, <text>My daughter and I both laughed out loud and gasped in horror as we read this book</text>, <text>When it was over we had lots to discuss</text>, <text>Things like when it's good to be angry, how to express yourself and exactly what it means to be a good little girl</text>, <text>I believe Ms</text>, <text>Banks was urging girls to be balanced in our increasingly unbalanced world</text>, <text>I have not been a fan of the `Sabriel' series by Garth Nix</text>, <text>I found their preoccupation with death a little morbid for my tastes</text>, <text>However, I recognised a considerable story-telling talent, and suspected I would really enjoy this author with a different subject matter</text>, <text>and I was correct</text>, <text>This is a magical story, equally suitable for either boys or girls</text>, <text>Magic is not used arbitrarily as a convenient flash-bang solution for every problem, as is so often the case in this genre, but rather, requires logical application by the central character</text>, <text>I especially enjoyed the uncertainty I felt with many supporting characters in this story, never entirely sure until the final pages exactly who could be trusted</text>, <text>Nix has managed to avoid creating people who are stereotypically either good or bad</text>, <text>We may doubt the motives of those who appear good, and forgive the actions of those who seem evil, once we learn more about them</text>, <text>The hero makes wise decisions - but I wouldn't be at all surprised if they came back to `bite him' later in the week!</text>, <text>The plot is well-paced, gripping and full of surprising twists and turns</text>, <text>This is an adventure as exciting as you could wish for - and never predictable</text>, <text>However, I did feel one particular scene might be rather nightmare-inducing for the youngest readers - so recommend this for the ages of 12 and above</text>, <text>If you didn't like 'Sabriel' - don't be put off; give Mr Monday a try</text>, <text>You won't be dissapointed!</text>, <text>It's a pleasure to see Garth Nix's Keys To The Kingdom: Mister Monday in affordable paperback, presenting the first book in the series for a new generation of readers in an affordable paper format</text>, <text>Arthur is slated to die an early death but his life is saved by a key shaped like a clock's hand � a key which brings with it the power not only to reverse predictions, but to introduce bizarre creates into the world</text>, <text>Suddenly everyone is fighting for ownership of a key which will change the world in this first book of a gripping adventure</text>, <text>Ilove the book</text>, <text>how did Bebe think of it? I read a lot and I've read good books but Class Trip&amp; Class TripII(2)are at the top of my list!!!!</text>, <text>In this last look at Hercule Poirot we see him and his friend Hastings at Styles where we were first introduced to this incredible Belgian</text>, <text>Only Agatha Christie would think to bring an end to her hero in this way</text>, <text>This is the ultimate crime and the ultimate murderer</text>, <text>Talk about going out with a bang!  The whole book is one big deceit, and Poirot is the biggest deceiver of all</text>, <text>It's certainly a shocker</text>, <text>I have read all of the Poirot books, and this book happens to be the last one of these stories that I've read</text>, <text>I think that's fitting</text>, <text>I never could bring myself to read it before because I couldn't bear that it was the last of the little Belgian detective</text>, <text>But one thing about Poirot books, and this one is no exception, it can certatinly be read and enjoyed again</text>, <text>They are all complex enough that certain things are missed in the first reading</text>, <text>Ms</text>, <text>Christie was an absolute marvel!</text>, <text>This started as a promising story</text>, <text>I couldn't put it down in the beginning</text>, <text>It was a real story about a real boy in an exciting, intriguing situation</text>, <text>Then, somewhere in the middle, it just got weirder and odder and more confusing</text>, <text>And the stranger it got, the less interested I felt</text>, <text>It was difficult to visualize a world where every single thing (everything!) is unfamiliar</text>, <text>People don't look like people</text>, <text>Buildings don't look like buildings</text>, <text>It was hard to care about the side characters, because they were so bizarre</text>, <text>I love fantasy and science fiction, but this storyteller forgot something very important</text>, <text>The reader needs something familiar to help them relate to the story and characters</text>, <text>I definitely won't read the rest of this series</text>, <text>Blah!  Way too strange and confusing!</text>, <text>The children's novel \"keys of the Kingdom Mister Monday\" is a hardcore mix beetween mystery and science fiction</text>, <text>This is a 361 page book about a boy named Arthur Penhaligon who is destined to die an early death, but is saved by a key given to him by a mysterious man named Mister Monday</text>, <text>After being given the key he notices many strange things happening around his neighborhood</text>, <text>Including a strange house a few blocks away from his house</text>, <text>he journeys up the house into Mister Monday's room on the top floor of the house</text>, <text>After Arthur defeats Mister Monday he surrenders his strange powers to \"The Will\"</text>, <text>I liked the way the author described all imnportant and  non-important characters in such detail, but I didn't like the way he kept coming back to the question \"why did Arthur get the key, why is he still alive, who are Mister Monday and Sneezer\"</text>, <text>My favorite character in this book was Noon the first big Villain or henchman of Mister Monday</text>, <text>He is my favorite character because he has and awesome outfit, I mean there aren't many guys waliking around with wings and a flaming sword</text>, <text>My favorite secton or scene was when mister monday &amp; Sneezer first appeared</text>, <text>I liked the way the author made it so i could picture it in my head</text>, <text>What i would say to someone about this book is about a nobody kid who ends up saving the world</text>, <text>One question I have is what happens after you fall asleep during the process of the \"Sleepy Plague\"</text>, <text>I would strongely recommend this book for someone who likes a book in which they can picture all of the important moments</text>, <text>This spectacular book is soooo funny, but at the end there's a real surprise</text>, <text>If you have read it you know what I mean</text>, <text>This spectacular book is sweet, but evil</text>, <text>The fabulous author had a brilliant idea which emphasizes the intention of two twin sisters, one angelic and one diabloic</text>, <text>When you read this book, you fell pleased and mad</text>, <text>You will feel virtuous and inferior during this book, but at the end, you will feel medium</text>, <text>You will see what I mean (when I say medium) after you read this fabulous, excellent, nourishing, book</text>, <text>I loved this book so much</text>, <text>I first read it at school</text>, <text>It's one of those books that keep you turning the page and craving for more</text>, <text>I think it was awesome and everyone should read it</text>, <text>The characters were amazing and full of life</text>, <text>The storyline was incredible</text>, <text>It was just awesome</text>, <text>It completely blew me away</text>, <text>It's the next best thing after the Harry Potter books</text>, <text>Pretty boring book</text>, <text>After about the first chapter I wondered if it would get any better</text>, <text>It didn't</text>, <text>Half way through I wanted to give up, but things were just starting to move, so I didn't</text>, <text>I couldn't get past the fact that it all was so contrived, with the profiler magically pulling predictions about the criminal out of thin air</text>, <text>Definitely not worth the read</text>, <text>If you find that you're not really believing the characters after the first chapter or two, bail out</text>, <text>Read something else</text>, <text>This book is well written and extremely intrigueing,as I found; once I started it, I couldn't put it down! It rocks!Garth Nix has a way with words</text>, <text>Already a huge fan of Garth Nix, via Sabriel &amp; co</text>, <text>, I admit I came into Mister Monday with rather high expectations</text>, <text>As far as story goes, Mr</text>, <text>Nix certainly did not disappoint</text>, <text>It is captivating from beginning to end with an extraordinary imaginative quality that is his trademark</text>, <text>However, 2 qualms I have with the book prevent me from giving it full marks</text>, <text>First, the overuse of what seems to be the main character's (Arthur) only fault: his asthma</text>, <text>The first asthma attack successfully helps readers to sympathize with Arthur</text>, <text>However, by the end of the first 100 pages, you feel like screaming, \"GET AN INHALER AND SHUT UP!\" So much so, I jokingly told my friend that Mister Monday's real title is The Amazing Adventures of Asthmatic Arthur</text>, <text>The belaboring of this point is very distracting, though humorous</text>, <text>Secondly, the narrative isn't up to par with Mr</text>, <text>Nix's previous work</text>, <text>It's often choppy or unclear and I would imagine that its targetted age group would have difficulty following his train of thought</text>, <text>But, overall, Mister Monday is a page turner that's so creative and captivating, its shortcomings are largely made up for</text>, <text>I first heard about John Keay in another book by William Dalrymple where he wrote that John was an inspiration to him to write about India</text>, <text>This in turn inspired me to buy this book</text>, <text>As an Indian, this book was revealing and awe-inspiring by the scope of the discoveries that it describes</text>, <text>It is unimaginable that many (even more) important centres of history/culture have been destroyed or are maintained poorly and are falling to ruin</text>, <text>This book is very well documented in parts, obviously backed by a lot of research, that tells facts as they were discovered</text>, <text>The detail given is unmatched</text>, <text>This is a must read for any Indian history buff</text>, <text>Garth Nix's 'Mister Monday' was a highly clever, creative, and entertaining read that had me up into the wee hours of the morning following Arthur's adventures in the House</text>, <text>Arthur Penhaligon was a believable hero who after strange creatures called Fetchers bring a sleeply plague to his town, with his newly acquired key, Arthur must venture into the mysterious House that only he can see to save his town</text>, <text>Obviously, Nix wrote this book for a younger audience so his writing wasn't as</text>, <text>mature as it was in his brilliant Abhorsen trilogy</text>, <text>But the sheer imagination Nix brings to this book more than makes up for it</text>, <text>The intricate world of the House was highly entertaing and origional and Nix stuns me every time he writes a new story</text>, <text>'Mister Monday' has everything a hugely popular series needs, loveable characters, a complex plot, and buckets loads of creativity</text>, <text>'Grim Tuesday' is certainly going on my wish list!</text>, <text>Angela and Diabola is a silly, funny and a great book</text>, <text>I loved the chapter: Diabola develops new skills</text>, <text>I loved it because Diabola asking for money and sending away those 2 people with the invisibe gun that shot 1 of them away</text>, <text>I also loved the chapter: Gym and other lessons</text>, <text>I liked it when Dybo pushed the miss Mursles off the climbing frame without any clothes on!  I think that Angela and Diabola is the best book I read this year!!!!!!!!!!</text>, <text>Book: My Darling My Hamburger&lt;br&gt;Author: Paul Zindel&lt;br&gt;Number of Pages: 122&lt;br&gt;Publisher and Publication Date: 1969 Harper and Row publishers&lt;br&gt;ISBN: 0-553-27324-8&lt;br&gt;Price (if available) and whether it is paperback or hardback: Hardback \t   Imagine if you had parents that never trusted, or that never would believe you</text>, <text>Or even worse what if you had a stepparent that would call u some pretty bad names and your mom would take his side</text>, <text>Well that is kind of what this book is about</text>, <text>&lt;br&gt;\tThe main characters in My Darling My Hamburger are two girls named Liz and Maggie</text>, <text>They are of course best friends</text>, <text>They are also both seniors in high school</text>, <text>It is about time for prom and they both have dates</text>, <text>But you'll never guess what happens next!!!&lt;br&gt;\tI think that this book is a really good book</text>, <text>Personal I loved My Darling My Hamburger</text>, <text>It has a really good moral</text>, <text>It was just like a real story</text>, <text>Everything in this book is based on what is happening in real life</text>, <text>That is just my opinion</text>, <text>&lt;br&gt;\t When I read this book it reminded me of one of my friends sister</text>, <text>She has just graduated and basically the same thing that has happened to one of the girls in this story</text>, <text>I am not going to tell you the rest but I guess that you will just have to read and find out for your self</text>, <text>&lt;br&gt;\tI would definitely recommend this book to People in 6th-9th grade</text>, <text>The main gender that would want to read this book would be girls because of what the story is based on and because they can relate to it the best</text>, <text>The people that wouldn't like this would be boys</text>, <text>Why?

(kids look up the reference to King Arthur)</text>, <text>Nix makes some interesting speculations upon the origins of the universe</text>, <text>This is also very enjoyable as read by Allan Corduner, and is available from amazon</text>, <text>com in audio book format</text>, <text>kotori 2004</text>, <text>ok maybe not soo much, but a couple of pages and</text>, <text>I was hooked!!&lt;br&gt;Garth Nix is a awesome writer and though the book is a little babyish - its definetly worth a read!&lt;br&gt;I thought the whole minute - hand - is - a - key part was a real good idea plus the names are so fun!&lt;br&gt;The only thing I didn't like was that Arthur doesen't take his rightful place as \"Monday\"</text>, <text>He chose to go home which, no offense to anyone, is a little wimpy!&lt;br&gt;On Athur Phenaligon's first day at his new school, things don't go quite as he had expected</text>, <text>His gym teacher forces him to run a cross country race even though he explains that he had just recovered from a serious bout of Asthama</text>, <text>&lt;br&gt;Arthur runs the race and (Big Surprise) suffers an asthama attack</text>, <text>He was about to die when he was handed a minute shaped key from Mister Monday</text>, <text>Er hello? where did THAT come in?&lt;br&gt;Assuming it to be a hallucination Arthur tries to forget about it as he is rushed into the hospital</text>, <text>When he recovers, the \"key\" and \" A Compleat Atlas of The House\" are still there</text>, <text>&lt;br&gt;Thats when Arthur awakens to the reality of his dream</text>, <text>&lt;br&gt;Along with the key comes these</text>, <text>creatures who bring a plague scientist simply can't find a cure for</text>, <text>Arthur is desperate and so ventures into \"The House\" where the answers seems to lie</text>, <text>Did I mention he was the only one who could see it?&lt;br&gt;Within the house Arthur meets the \"Piper's Children\" (You heard me!)Actually one of them in particular - Suzy Turquoise Blue and along with her they face many</text>, <text>um \"perils\" as well as the complications of the house and it's creator, The ArchitectAnyway read this book, its way cool</text>, <text>I thought that it was a very good book</text>, <text>It really made me think which is hard because I'm not a big reader</text>, <text>It delt with two high schoolers and every thing that can happen to them now these days</text>, <text>After reading the Sabriel series, I was hoping this book would be just as good</text>, <text>Though this series isn't one of his best, his style and vivid imagination is still very present</text>, <text>Garth Nix creates a whole new world for us to explore</text>, <text>The story starts off on a Monday and it is Arthur Penhaligon's first day of school</text>, <text>While running during gym class, he gets an asthma attack</text>, <text>Gasping for breath, two strange men visit him and give him a book and a key</text>, <text>Using these two mysterious objects, he learns about a whole new world</text>, <text>Weird and dangerous creatures are hunting him down, trying to retrieve the key</text>, <text>A couple of days later, his town is invaded by a Sleepy Plague, and Arthur has no other choice but to enter the House and try to save his city</text>, <text>I strongly recommend this book, even though it lacks the depth and maturity that was found in the Sabriel series</text>, <text>It is a great book for children ages 10-13 and Garth Nix creates a captivating and exciting world</text>, <text>If you are looking for a mystery forget it</text>, <text>The mystery is secondary to the rest of the story and is only really approached in the remaining 30 pages of the book</text>, <text>I found \"Skylar\" to be a better book, because the story was more original</text>, <text>As mentioned by one of the previous reviews that story centers around Jonathan Whitfield a \"yankee\" being the fish out of water around his cousin Skylar's southern surroundings</text>, <text>It seems this book was written just for the heck of it to see what it would be like to have Skylar up north</text>, <text>In \"Skylar\" we learn that the dumb hick image that Skylar puts on is all a facade and that he is truly a clever person</text>, <text>This story while showing glimpses of his intelligence disappointingly reverts to this original perception and it feels like you are reading the same story again</text>, <text>If you are interested in reading a Gregory MacDonald book then read one of the earlier Fletch novels</text>, <text>They don't actually read like the Chevy Chase movies but they are witty and worth the time (with the occasional weak book in the mix)</text>, <text>If you have already read all the Fletch stories then you can give \"Skylar\" a try, but don't expect it to be on par with them</text>, <text>I would recommend the Flynn stories: \"The Buck Passes Flynn\",\"Flynn\", &amp; \"Flynn's In\" (about a boston detective/government agent)</text>, <text>You may not be able to order them but you can be sure to find them in a used book store, and they are definitely more worth while than the Skylar books</text>, <text>This book was pretty good</text>, <text>I would suggest that you be under the age of 1726</text>, <text>Being the old hag of an elf that I am,     14 is pretty old you know,I wanted the pleasure of reading youngster material</text>, <text>So I did</text>, <text>In a tearful heartwarming story, we see that Mog has a next of kin</text>, <text>With her hands full with two little kittens, Mog is unable to leave her cat box (with the kittens) to sleep with Nicky</text>, <text>Two of Nicky's friends come by to visit Mog and the kittens, wishing that they themselves had a kitten</text>, <text>The kittens actually want homes of their own</text>, <text>Nicky decides to give the two kittens to the very same (two young girls) friends who were admiring them</text>, <text>The two girls' families are shown, happy, with Mog's kittens</text>, <text>While Nicky and Mog are sad at first, they both realize that it's what's best for all involved, and Mog resumes sleeping with Nicky again</text>, <text>If you were a mother with twins it could be hard</text>, <text>But imgiane if&lt;br&gt;you were Mrs</text>, <text>Cuberson-Jones!One as an angel called \"Angela\" and another as a devil called \"Diabola\"</text>, <text>Watch out for Angela's beauty and Diabola's devilness</text>, <text>With a lot of 'twinnish', a language which is used by the twins to communicate, Diabola talks to Angela because she does not know how to speak a lot of English</text>, <text>But when they go to school the principal thinks Diabola is a genius</text>, <text>But wait till she makes her funny mistake! Watch out for a ton of fun!</text>, <text>I was given this book as a gift in 1993 and since then I have given it to several Native American women as a gift and all were VERY impressed</text>, <text>It truly gives honor to all Native Women and the traditions and culture that makes them so rich and alive</text>, <text>AHO!</text>, <text>The story of Angela and Diabola all begins when Mrs</text>, <text>Cuterston-Jones gives birth to twins with compleatly different personalities</text>, <text>Angela was born  with the personality of an angel where as her twin sister Diabola was born  with the personality of a devil</text>, <text>Angela and Diabola's mother and father  soon figure out that Angela and Diabola aren't going to balance any time  soon</text>, <text>Angela and Diabola's mother and father start to realize that being  around each other Angela and Diabola are slowly balancing</text>, <text>I give this book  five stars because it wasn't to long and it was written in a reasonable  sized print</text>, <text>I also like this book because it was funny and it was about  something that doesn't happen everyday</text>, <text>Some early young adult novels (it's a fairly new form of literature, you know) age gracefully and seamlessly</text>, <text>I'm thinking of course of Robert Cormier's \"The Chocolate War\" and (to a lesser extent), S</text>, <text>E</text>, <text>Hinton?s, \"The Outsiders\"</text>, <text>Unfortunately, I have a nasty suspicion that these books are the exception rather than the rule</text>, <text>For every \"Forever\" there's a \"My Darling, My Hamburger\" that contains a great story bogged down by changes in the world</text>, <text>While Paul Zindel's classic tale of four teenagers and their relationship problems is at times both moving and perfectly toned, mostly the problems presented in it are as dated as they come</text>, <text>Even a plot synopsis makes this apparent</text>, <text>&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Friends Maggie and Liz aren't exactly close, but they hang out frequently together</text>, <text>Liz is the more beautiful and popular of the two with Maggie often following behind</text>, <text>When Liz and her boyfriend Sean decide to hook up Maggie with his friend Dennis, the blind date is as incredibly awkward as they come</text>, <text>Throughout the book the narrative switches between Maggie and her tentative relationship with Dennis and Liz's problems with Sean</text>, <text>Sean, like any normal teenager, is as horny as they come and is continually pressuring Liz to have sex</text>, <text>She'd like to, but she worries that it might end up in pregnancy</text>, <text>Unsurprisingly, that is exactly what happens and soon the big question in the book is whether or not Sean will do the honorable thing and marry Liz (!!) or if Liz will seek out an illegal abortion on her own</text>, <text>&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;It's this last plotline that struck me as dated</text>, <text>The book was originally written in 1969, a full three years before Roe V</text>, <text>Wade and in many ways this abortion issue (while it still looms large) isn't the same</text>, <text>Sure, many girls will sweat over what to do with an unplanned pregnancy, but crossing the border to a state where abortion is legal is probably a more up-to-date literary solution than getting a back alley job</text>, <text>Then there's the debate about whether a girl should marry the guy who gets her pregnant, regardless of how old they are or what their future plans are</text>, <text>Maybe there are pockets of the country where this really is the only honorable solution to such a problem, but it's really not how the majority of teens would handle it today</text>, <text>The book is additionally riddled with small cultural time capsules as well</text>, <text>Talk about how Orientals kill themselves for honor, going to the movie theater to watch a documentary on pygmies, and the complete and total lack of any mention of STDs all combine to make this book an interesting window into the past</text>, <text>To some degree it does still speak to teens today</text>, <text>I was especially amused by the Sex Ed</text>, <text>teacher's advice on how to stop a guy from going all the way, (suggest going out for a hamburger)</text>, <text>The characters were interesting as well</text>, <text>Liz, unfortunately, isn't a character you're going to identify with intrinsically</text>, <text>Yes, it's sad that she doesn't get along with her parents</text>, <text>But she's such a self-absorbed person, constantly ridiculing her best friend and at the same time dragging Maggie into horrid and dangerous situations, that by the end you feel zippo pity for her</text>, <text>In fact, you're supposed to end this story hating and pitying Sean who got her pregnant in the first place</text>, <text>Curse those lustful young men that refuse to marry their knocked up girlfriends! Curse them! This book probably read very well in the 1970s and I could even see it having some interesting points in the 1980s</text>, <text>But by the 1990s with the advent of AIDS better known and the options available to teens widening, books like this one began to read more as cautionary tales than as contemporary novels</text>, <text>I've no doubt that \"My Darling, My Hamburger\" was riveting and shocking when it first came out</text>, <text>Unfortunately, that's certainly no longer the case</text>, <text>I recommend it as a glimpse into the America that once was</text>, <text>If you'd like to know more about the history of the Young Adult novel, this is a good book to pick up</text>, <text>Just don't expect it to have too many insights to offer today</text>, <text>I'm afraid it's no longer that meaningful</text>, <text>I don't want to get married</text>, <text>I thought this book would be an explanation into how I feel</text>, <text>It turned out to be so much more, it does not bash marriage as I originally thought it would</text>, <text>The book is a great read right until the end, so rare in non-fiction</text>, <text>It has many historical facts that are fascinating! Great book, I will read it again and again</text>, <text>I LOVE THIS BOOK!&lt;br&gt;This is one of the best books ever</text>, <text>I have also read Garth Nix's \"The Seventh Tower\" series</text>, <text>I love his writing style</text>, <text>&lt;br&gt;The title of this review says it all- I CAN'T WAIT until he releases his next book, Grim Tuesday</text>, <text>Regards from California and Hold On to your KEY TO THE KINGDOM</text>, <text>THe last Poirot case was a heartbreaking affair</text>, <text>Anyway, Agatha Christie wrote one of the best Poirot novels ever</text>, <text>It seem she wrote it in the 40's, but in was only published in 1975</text>, <text>Great novel, the ever faithful Captain Arthur Hastings is narrating, and things go out with a bang</text>, <text>I thought this was a very well written story with just enough of an explanation to let your imagination fill in the blanks</text>, <text>In this period of formula this and that, this book was just strange enough to entertain and legitimate enough to engross</text>, <text>I loved it!</text>, <text>I read this book to my 6th grade language arts class to start the year</text>, <text>It allows us to discuss good-vs-evil, and to hear a hilariously funny book</text>, <text>We frequently stop to make predictions about what will happen next</text>, <text>Everytime I stop reading, they want more</text>, <text>Rating System:</text>, <text>1 star = abysmal; some books deserve to be forgotten</text>, <text>2 star = poor; a total waste of time</text>, <text>3 star = good; worth the effort</text>, <text>4 star = very good; what writing should be</text>, <text>5 star = fantastic; must own it and share it with others</text>, <text>THE STORY:</text>, <text>Arthur Penhaligon is a boy weakened by asthma and in having to live in the shadow of a very successful family</text>, <text>His normal life of interrupting his family's lives because they have to rush him to the hospital due to asthma attacks changes when he finds himself the chosen heir to the House</text>, <text>Arthur with the lesser key to the lower kingdom of the House in hand, must travel into the House to find a cure for the mysterious plague that is striking the people of his town and his loved ones and find out why there are beings intent on getting the key from him, even if it means killing him</text>, <text>THE GOOD:</text>, <text>Garth Nix is becoming one of my favorite authors of all time</text>, <text>His fantasy works are not cliché or based on traditional fantasy but they are full of fresh, imagination and worlds and characters we can learn to love</text>, <text>I got hooked on this author after reading Sabriel, which is a fantasy about necromancer magic</text>, <text>Very cool! So when I saw he had a new series out I had to check it out and was not disappointed</text>, <text>1) Great world creation in the House and the denizens of the House, their purpose, their origins, etc</text>, <text>Made for an interesting and unique setting</text>, <text>2) Likeable characters that are led by the plot of the story, where options are reduced forcing the protagonists down certain routes but without the reader knowing what those results those routes will produce, per se</text>, <text>Kept the plot and characters engaging and fun to read</text>, <text>3) Magic</text>, <text>Unique and fun and innovative</text>, <text>Loved everything about it!</text>, <text>4) 98% of all storylines and subplots resolved in this single volume</text>, <text>Chapters had great cliff hangers and transition points to keep the reader turning and the end of the book has its own cliff hanger that makes us want to read the next book in the series though it isn't necessary</text>, <text>5) As much as the storylines are resolved, the resolution was also satisfactory and didn't make me feel cheated or the author tried too hard or too little to provide a satisfying ending</text>, <text>THE BAD:</text>, <text>I don't have anything that comes to mind other than this wasn't a hugely character driven story but more plot driven and setting driven in my mind</text>, <text>To get more in the characters and their motivations would have been a plus but because the story focus is on the discovery of the House and things related to the House, I didn't expect to get into the characters more than we did and thus I really wasn't too disappointed</text>, <text>OVERALL:</text>, <text>I left with the feeling of having been in a fairy tale</text>, <text>This would make a GREAT movie in my opinion</text>, <text>Read Garth Nix for unique and engaging fantasy</text>, <text>Either read the Abhorsen Trilogy for more of an adult fantasy, where the main protagonist is 17-18 yrs of age</text>, <text>Read this series for a protagonist that is around 12 yrs of age and the scenes are less \"dark\" than the Abhorsen trilogy</text>, <text>Either way, both stories are a big win</text>, <text>I listened to this audio book becuase it was lying around</text>, <text>It wasn't inspiring or enlightening</text>, <text>Too many characters and plot twists leave the reader wondering who is who and what is going on</text>, <text>It would have been more interesting if it was real</text>, <text>As one who hasn't read any other books by the author, my viewpoint stands in a vacuum</text>, <text>The ending seems trite and fumbles for closure</text>, <text>The sophistication and talent that a writer needs to maintain two plot lines and ferry seven characters through a full-length novel, may be a challenge to author Val McDermid, but she does it with style, believability and panache in THE LAST TEMPTATION</text>, <text>A serial killer is targeting psychologists in Germany and Holland</text>, <text>When an old friend is murdered, former British profiler Tony Hill reluctantly gets back into the game</text>, <text>His job is to outsmart the killer and prevent any more brutal \"mutilation\" deaths</text>, <text>At the same time, Carol Jordan, a very ambitious DCI and the love of Hill's life, is offered any position she wants if she does her superiors a \"favor\" --- seduce Tadeusz Radecki into a sting that will expose his drug, arms and people smuggling businesses</text>, <text>This seems to be an offer she can't refuse</text>, <text>But, by the time she finds out that she's been set up, it's too late to back out</text>, <text>She feels betrayed and used when she discovers that she is the \"twin\" image of Katerina Basler, Tadisck's lover who was killed in a mysterious hit and run accident</text>, <text>Hill's murder investigation eventually brings him to Berlin</text>, <text>And, although he must travel to several European cities, he takes a small apartment in the same building as Jordan</text>, <text>Both of them work with local cops, Jordan with Petra Becker in Germany, and Hill with Brigadier Marijke van Hasselt from Holland</text>, <text>THE LAST TEMPTATION is an aggregate of pristine prose, complicated plot twists, roller coaster pacing, intelligent characters, and very interesting subject matter</text>, <text>McDermid writes with finesse and her extraordinary storytelling prowess sets her new book apart from the ordinary</text>, <text>Wow! This book is a sure fire winner</text>, <text>--- Reviewed by Barbara Lipkien Gershenbaum</text>, <text>I came upon this book while browsing my local Barnes and Nobles</text>, <text>I was hesitant to purchase it thinking just what the world needs is another take off of Harry Potter</text>, <text>After reading several pages I relented and purchased Mister Monday</text>, <text>I could not put the book down</text>, <text>Garth Nix does an excellant job of intertwining the real world with that of the big house</text>, <text>His characters are believable and descriptions vivid</text>, <text>I found myself staying up late to finish so that I could pass it on to my students</text>, <text>They have enjoyed it too</text>, <text>I just purchased the second book (Tuesday) and I see that Wednesday (the third)is out in hardback</text>, <text>This is a great series of books!  One that I highly recommend</text>, <text>It is to bad some reviewers think Anne has a chip on her shoulder</text>, <text>It seems  when women \"net\" out and describe reality from a different viewpoint, males seem to take the position that women are upset, have chips or are angry</text>, <text>This is a great book and one that gets you thinking about marriage</text>, <text>Some items you might agree or disagree but it will leave you with a well rounded perspective on the topic</text>, <text>Highly recommended</text>, <text>Michael Coogan</text>, <text>Co-Author Know Your Pig - Playful Relationship Advice for Understanding your  Man(Pig)</text>, <text>www</text>, <text>knowyourpig</text>, <text>com</text>, <text>Mister Monday is the first in a seven book series</text>, <text>Written for young adults this is a book that can be enjoyed by anyone who loves a good fantasy story</text>, <text>Arthur Penhaligon is about to die - only to be saved by the unlikely duo of Mr Monday and his butler Sneezer</text>, <text>An action they both will soon regret as Arthur finds the key they have given him leads to an otherworldly house that is both the source of a plague in his town and the only place he can find a cure</text>, <text>This is an original book, well written with interesting characters</text>, <text>Recommended for all ages</text>, <text>I'm already looking forward to GRIM TUESDAY and I'm happy the good news I heard on the grapevine turned out to be true about MISTER MONDAY</text>, <text>Lynne Reid Banks is a well-thought ,unique, interesting mind</text>, <text>&lt;br&gt;This novel is about twins,one good one bad</text>, <text>Most people are born to be (hopefully more) good with imperfections thrown in</text>, <text>But when these 2 were conceived something went awry</text>, <text>Angela has all goodness,while Diabolo is utterly disgusting</text>, <text>It is an off-beat,slightly wacky and very page-turning book,that I imagine would make a really fun family movie with a similiar humour to Matilda</text>, <text>I first stumbled across Michael Marshall in one of those gift shops you find in bigger hotels</text>, <text>I wandered over to the paperback \"section\" --- it was a wall mounting, containing slots for nine titles --- and I noticed the name \"Michael Marshall\" on a copy of THE STRAW MEN</text>, <text>I went to grade school with a Michael Marshall, so I picked up the book to see if perhaps it was the same gentleman</text>, <text>They turned out to be different people altogether</text>, <text>But I was so intrigued by the premise of the novel that I bought it, read it and quickly sought out the remainder of the author's bibliography</text>, <text>THE INTRUDERS is Marshall's latest work, combining his trademark elements of unpredictability, craftsmanship and sterling characterization to provide an addicting, thrilling read that never disappoints</text>, <text>If you're paranoid at all, you're going to get your instincts jumpstarted within a few pages of reading THE INTRUDERS</text>, <text>The story deals primarily with Jack Whalen, a man who is unsettled by the feeling that his world is slowly, almost imperceptibly, changing</text>, <text>Whalen is an ex-LAPD patrolman who retired from the force, wrote a book of some nominal success and now lives with his wife Amy --- a successful marketing executive --- in a small rural community a few hours removed from Seattle</text>, <text>Their world seems to be financially and emotionally secure</text>, <text>But, as Marshall slowly reveals, there are tiny cracks around the foundation of the Whalen family --- not necessarily fissures or yawning chasms, but cracks nonetheless</text>, <text>When Amy turns up missing during what would otherwise be a routine business trip to Seattle, Jack immediately begins to investigate, only to discover that her disappearance is more a misunderstanding than anything else</text>, <text>That's not the end of it, however</text>, <text>Jack notices that his wife is doing little things --- acquiring new habits, listening to different music --- that she has never done before</text>, <text>Taken together, they portend the arrival of something far beyond anything that Jack can imagine</text>, <text>In the meantime, events occurring that appear far removed from Jack's world will jeopardize his very existence</text>, <text>A mysterious stranger breaks into a house, brutally murders a woman and her son, and sets the house on fire</text>, <text>A young girl, walking alone on a beach, is approached by a polite man and shortly thereafter leaves without explanation, even as her demeanor begins to change</text>, <text>And Amy? She just gets more and more bizarre</text>, <text>As you're reading, you will probably find yourself wondering just how Marshall is going to tie up such apparently disparate elements into a cohesive story, and to what ultimate end</text>, <text>What Marshall does, however, is not only create a chilling tale that will keep you awake at night, but he also provides a possible answer to a question that has puzzled individuals for hundreds of years: What, precisely, makes us what, and who, we are?</text>, <text>Those familiar with Marshall's body of work wish that he would write more frequently</text>, <text>But when he publishes a novel of such quality as THE INTRUDERS, one remembers that any book of his is worth the wait, no matter how long it may be</text>, <text>--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub</text>, <text>I read this when I was in junior high school over 20 years ago</text>, <text>Now I felt that it was a great depiction of teenage life that I wanted to share with my teenage daughter as she searches to find herself as she enters the  pre-dating scene</text>, <text>I highly recommend this book to any parent that does not  know how to express the many things that they went through as a teenager to  their children</text>, <text>For our children are exposed to a much different lifestyle  than we were many years ago</text>, <text>In a book subtitled, \"The Life and World of Al Capone\", one would suspect an in depth look at the famous Chicagoan</text>, <text>While the book has points where it is very informative, I believe the author could have used a more involved editor in composing his book</text>, <text>Having originally gone into publication in 1971, there are better books about Al Capone</text>, <text>In the first hundred pages, Al Capone's name is literally mentioned only about five times</text>, <text>I respect the author's motive for formatting the book this way</text>, <text>He was trying to set up the world that gave rise to a gang leader like Al Capone</text>, <text>However, some of the stories could have been left out</text>, <text>At times, I found myself wondering if the author would ever start discussing Capone</text>, <text>The author begins the story of Capone in his service to Johnny Torrio</text>, <text>Eventually, this relationship develops more into a partnership than a hierarchy</text>, <text>Capone was very aggressive in furthering his interests even if the price was murder</text>, <text>La Cosa Nostra and organized crime in America thrived under the laws of prohibition</text>, <text>The illegally produced and supplied alcohol was only produced by those willing to disobey the way</text>, <text>It was a chance Capone was to take</text>, <text>Additionally, Capone made his money from gambling and racketeering</text>, <text>The generous side of Capone is one that is less frequently discussed</text>, <text>He donated much of his wealth to the poor which is more than can be said for the contemporary crooks and gangsters of corporate America</text>, <text>With this comparison in mind, it seems odd that the government finally crumbled the Capone empire with charges of tax evasion</text>, <text>Capone was sentenced to eleven years, but served less than six due to good behavior and the terminal phase of syphilis</text>, <text>I was disappointed to discover the end of the book</text>, <text>The author followed through with the title in the beginning with an overwhelming introduction</text>, <text>Unfortunately, the author chose to describe Capone's effect on the world in seven pages</text>, <text>I believe the author could have said more of the world of Al Capone more in terms of his after effects</text>, <text>In total, I found this book to be more than adequate</text>, <text>While it is flawed and inconsistent, it is a worthwhile primer for those seeking to learn of Capone</text>, <text>At times, the author goes into great detail demonstrating the work put into this project</text>, <text>However, the amount of work is not always consistent with the final project</text>, <text>I've read alot of books, but this one stuck out in my head</text>, <text>It had a total turn of things, it wasn't the same as other books you might read</text>, <text>I kind of suspected the killer to be who it was</text>, <text>but it sure was different :</text>, <text>As a newly-wed, always independent female, my first year of marriage has met confusion over new roles, career goals and what my new title of \"wife\" really implied</text>, <text>I turned somewhat to rebellion - as did my husband in his new title, with all it's implications of \"breadwinner\" - I do not want the traditional house wife role</text>, <text>I never played that role in the five years we lived together prior to the wedding ring and all of a sudden that ring, which is supposed to represent the unity and fairytale love we are bombarded with daily, became what I had always thought of as a ridiculous metaphor for marriage: a ball and chain</text>, <text>I felt trapped</text>, <text>The reason I am writing this now, is not because I had some self-awakening and suddenly came into my own as a wifely figure</text>, <text>I did not follow my wild daydream of suddenly, and with no real plan, driving into the sunset toward \"liberty</text>, <text>\"  I did not go file for divorce, which is the popular and easy thing to do</text>, <text>I simply read a book</text>, <text>\"The Meaning of Wife,\" by Anne Kingston, is an eye-opening page turner, which confronts social patterns, ideologies, and generalizations of what it means to not only be a wife, but a woman in Western Society</text>, <text>While reading this book, I was forced to confront some of my own pre-conceived notions of what it means to be a wife, mother, career woman, domestic, caretaker, [</text>, <text>]</text>, <text>It also helped me to realize that in some of my ideals I have been unfair to the person I chose to make my partner for life, and vice versa</text>, <text>I am amazed by Kingston's ability to present different perspectives and surprised by her ability to resolve many issues</text>, <text>She does not represent a feminist hard-line but takes a logical stance that does not slap either sex across the face with shame</text>, <text>She was able to show all sides of a debate in each chapter, and then resolved with solutions that make the reader think, \"Now why didn't I think of that</text>, <text>It is so simple, so obvious</text>, <text>\"</text>, <text>I strongly believe that this book is not only a read for women, but men as well</text>, <text>As I said before, it is not a feminist manuscript meant to belittle men, but a bold confrontation of the roles assigned both sexes in Western Society</text>, <text>It focuses on the role of the wife, but in doing so, confronts the roles of the Husband</text>, <text>Believe it or not the only feminist book I have read in my life is, \"Communion,\" by Bell Hooks</text>, <text>This was a book I loved but had contradicting feelings about</text>, <text>It makes grand points of what it means to \"Commune\" with another, but showed little resolve toward such communion</text>, <text>One of my favorite quotes came from this book, \"To exist in a state of communion is to be aware of the nature of existence</text>, <text>\" (Susan Griffin)  However, it was not until reading, \"The Meaning of Wife,\" that I truly began to confront and make peace with my existence as a female and all the roles I play as an individual and as a partner in a communion I chose</text>, <text>Its Arthur Penhaglion's first day at school and things aren't going so well</text>, <text>Arthur has really bad asthma, but since the new gym teacher doesn't know it, Arthur is forced to run</text>, <text>He doesn't want to appear stupid on the first day of school, so he decides to run even though he knows it could be really devasting to his health</text>, <text>And lone behold, Arthur has a severe asthma attack</text>, <text>However, just as he is about to die, he is handed a key shaped like a minute hand from a mysterious person called Mr</text>, <text>Monday who definitely doesn't belong in our world</text>, <text>Arthur survives, but soon his whole world is turned upside down</text>, <text>Mysterious dog faced animals are chasing after Arthur trying to get back the key, and they've brought a mysterious Sleeping Plague with them that could kill thousands, if not millions, since the doctors seem to have no cure at all</text>, <text>Soon Arthur realizes, that he, himself will have to venture into \"The House\", a house that only he can see, to save his world from utter destruction</text>, <text>It is in \"The House\" that Arthur makes friends with Suzy Turquoise Blue, and learns from \"The Will\" of his true destiny and has his final showdown with Mr</text>, <text>Monday</text>, <text>I had high expectations for Garth Nix's new series since I was an absolute fanatic over his Sabriel Trilogy and The Seventh Towers Series</text>, <text>After reading the first chapter of this book, I knew that I wouldn't be disappointed as it just sucks you in</text>, <text>I found this book to be more darker than Garth Nix's past stories, but you can definitely tell his unique writing style</text>, <text>His story structure carries over and you can pinpoint many similarties with this book and his other works</text>, <text>Arthur is a great protagonist, though he lacks the charm of Sabriel and Tal from Garth Nix's previous books</text>, <text>I definitely recommend reading this book, though I feel it is a touch lower than Garth Nix's Sabriel and Seventh Tower</text>, <text>This is by far the best out of the four Dr</text>, <text>Hill books I've read</text>, <text>It is riveting, believable, and suspenseful</text>, <text>A definite must-read for McDermid fans!</text>, <text>This is the best book I ever read!  I couldn't put it down!  Still, I didn't like the end very much</text>, <text>I love the part where Diabola is throwing the chicken pieces!  I liked Angela's name, though</text>, <text>I have read and used this book many, many times</text>, <text>When I was just starting to bead, this book was a wealth of patterns and colors for me</text>, <text>And that was a long time ago</text>, <text>I believe it was written with children in mind, but if you  want to see Native American beadwork designs, and the traditional colors  that were used, this is the book</text>, <text>Full of atmosphere, world war II feel to it</text>, <text>He does a good job, in this whole series, of bringing Churchill to life as a very real and human character</text>, <text>It is a novel and not historical text book but he really takes you into the time and place</text>, <text>I've enjoyed this whole series, would recommend them to anyone who is interested in this era but remind them that they are fiction, good fiction never the less</text>, <text>I didn't like it AS much as some of the other books from Marshall (loved Spares, Only Forward and One Of Us), but still a darn good read</text>, <text>Really hated to see the protagonist slipping in thoughts of not having another book in him, hope that's not allegorical!</text>, <text>I do have a suggestion; if you're a \"happy\" person and like to read \"happy happy\" books, Michael Marshall is probably NOT for you</text>, <text>His characters/story lines are dark, the segues can be hard to keep up with, and you'll probably have to read the book at least twice to pick up on nuances you missed</text>, <text>The Intruders is no different in this regard, but that's why its so much fun to read!  If you like to be mentally twisted up in a book, Marshall's writing will accomodate you</text>, <text>He often comes across as being a great deal more about the sidebars/interactions/thoughts/situations than his actual endings</text>, <text>So, if you are looking for black and white/easy reads, he(and this book) is probably not going to be your cup of tea</text>, <text>This is coming from someone who likes both, so not slamming one genre over another</text>, <text>However, from reading a few of the reviews it seems like it might be good to say this upfront</text>, <text>Can Arthur save the world with the key as a young boy with asthma problems?  Arthur just moved to his new house</text>, <text>He now has to go school in the middle of the year</text>, <text>So he does not know anybody</text>, <text>When he has to run he has an asthma attack, and is out cold</text>, <text>He meets new friends</text>, <text>But when they leave someone name mister Monday comes, and gives Arthur the key</text>, <text>And then they leave, when Arthur touches the key he feels better</text>, <text>The key has tons of powers</text>, <text>When everyone starts getting sick from a plague, Arthur has to go in a special house and save everyone</text>, <text>He fights many battles, and also meets a friend on the way, in the end he stops Monday and saves everyone</text>, <text>This was a good book</text>, <text>It had a good story plot</text>, <text>There was good action</text>, <text>However, Arthur's behavior didn't match his age</text>, <text>This book had a good story plot</text>, <text>The whole key thing was a good idea</text>, <text>Also I thought it was really cool with the house, the way it was described I like it a lot</text>, <text>The characters were also cool and well thought out</text>, <text>I really liked all the action in this book</text>, <text>The first action seen was when Arthur was attacked by the pig men, and Afternoon</text>, <text>There was tons of fire, and it kept me on my feet, I didn't know what was going to happen and how he was going to get out of that situation</text>, <text>Also when Arthur was in the house he had many battles and such, and also the last fight</text>, <text>The thing I didn't like about this book is that Arthur didn't not seem like his age</text>, <text>He was in 7th grade but he didn't act like it</text>, <text>Him and his friends were very immature</text>, <text>He didn't know how to handle situations very well, but it always worked out for him</text>, <text>Suck as when there is a fire in the library, he goes to a locked door, but the key gets it open for him</text>, <text>This was a good book</text>, <text>Arthur, and young boy that was not athletic and had asthma problems, saved the whole world with his key</text>, <text>I recommend it to any other readers</text>, <text>You should pick it up</text>, <text>-J</text>, <text>Hamilton</text>, <text>Best of the Best</text>, <text>From the award-winning author of \"Snow Falling on Cedars\" comes the bold and beautiful story of a retired heart surgeon with cancer who heads toward the wooded territory of eastern Washington intending to commit suicide</text>, <text>Along the way, he is sidetracked by a succession of fortuitous events that draws him into an altogether unanticipated journey--and rekindles his appetite for life</text>]\n"
