2447,"Anni fa ho litigato con una persona che reputavo la più importante della mia vita. L'ho respinta e l'ho ferita, dicendo cose sbagliate e quindi facendola passare per quello che non era. Nonostante me ne sia pentita amaramente e abbia provato a riavvicinarmi, lei non mi ha più voluta nella sua vita (giustamente). Perdere questa persona è stato l'errore più brutto che abbia fatto e ancora, nonostante siano passati davvero tanti anni, non riesco a farmene una ragione e quando ci ripenso mi sento una merda. Adesso, ascoltando questa canzone, mi viene da piangere, perché la sua assenza, nonostante il tempo che passa, continua a fare un rumore assordante nella mia vita e non penso che riuscirò mai a mettere da parte tutto quello che di buono ci sia stato tra noi. Spero che un giorno potremo riavvicinarci in qualche modo e, magari, chiarire. Non lasciate andare le persone importanti. Lottate sempre per loro, perché quando le perdete definitivamente, è impossibile tornare a stare bene come prima che se ne andassero. Ovunque tu sia, se stai leggendo, sappi che ti voglio ancora tanto bene e te ne vorrò per sempre. Non dimenticherò mai i nostri abbracci. Ti chiedo scusa per tutto.",Sadness

2566,"Nella consegna di stamattina il vostro operatore si è rifiutato di portare la spesa al piano (anche se gli ho detto più volte che non avevo nessuna intenzione di aprire la porta di casa e che poteva lasciare tutto fuori come sempre senza alcun contatto diretto), adducendo non meglio precisate nuove istruzioni. Il tutto con la mascherina bellamente abbassata sotto il mento. Il risultato è che, quasi come favore, mi è stato messo tutto per terra nell'ascensore per poi tirare su io al piano la spesa, con buona pace dell'igiene e con i sacchetti uno sopra all'altro tutti schiacciati. Non capisco veramente il senso, vi ho già scritto reclamo ma lo ripeto anche qui. Per me no, ma per un anziano, oltre a quanto sopra lamentato, ciò comporta anche un'assurda fatica in più.

Sta avendo il successo che merita soprattutto perché ha fatto tanta gavetta."" Eccolo, il senso dell'arte. Provare, studiare, sperimentare e sperimentarsi. E poi raccogliere consensi giusti. Far parlare di se per quello che si canta e non per quello che si fa. La scimmia era soltanto il giusto trucco al momento giusto. Pippo Baudo si sbagliava. Tu sei sempre andato oltre.
